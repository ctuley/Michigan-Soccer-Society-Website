      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester City 2-1 Real Madrid (4-2 aggregate)</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City dominated Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid, and delivered the Frenchman his first Champions League exit as a manager. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. A Nightmare Match For Rafael Varane</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The French center-back has had an excellent season and has re-established himself as one of the best defenders in world football. Last night, however, Varane struggled mightily. He had two errors that lead to Manchester City goals, both of which could have been prevented by better decision-making. The first came in the ninth minute when Madrid was attempting to play out of the back. Varane had the ball taken off of him in his own penalty area by Gabriel Jesus, who squared the ball to Raheem Sterling for a tap in that set the tone for the game. The second mistake came in the second half when Varane was chasing a long pass in Madrid’s defensive third, and he was being pressured by Jesus. Varane attempted to head the ball back to Thibaut Courtois, but the header was too weak, and Jesus intercepted it and slotted the ball past Courtois for what was a very easy goal. Varane will be disappointed with his performance, but he will recover. Mistakes like this are few and far between for him, and it is unnatural to expect him to always play perfectly.

              Not a single Madrid player impressed me in this match. They were all overrun by a near-perfect Manchester City. Los Blancos’ backline couldn’t handle City’s intense press, and they could have easily conceded a couple more goals due to passing errors in their own defensive third. In the midfield, Casemiro, who is not known for his abilities in possession, was locked down by Manchester City’s midfielders and made it very tough for Madrid to play through the midfield. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric didn’t drop back far enough to offset this, and they were pretty much irrelevant unless Real Madrid was able to break City’s press. In attack, Real Madrid’s forwards found it very difficult to get past Manchester City’s high defensive line. It forced Los Blancos to play long balls to try and get their attackers on the ball, which City’s defenders handled expertly. Real Madrid’s goal came after Rodrygo got around left back João Cancelo, and found Karim Benzema with a cross. Sadly, Madrid couldn’t replicate their success through crossing again, as City’s full-backs wouldn’t make any more mistakes during the match.

      <h10><b>3. A Quiet But Effective Shift For Manchester City</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There were no wonder-strikes or free-kick goals today for City, but they won’t mind. This was a gritty performance, and they earned their win. The press from their attacking 5 suffocated Real Madrid’s players and won them this game. In possession, they kept the ball well and tested Thibaut Courtois often, usually with low shots from just outside the box. There was no point in this game where it looked like City would lose, from the start, they looked focused and ready to knock out Europe’s greatest ever side. It was a surprising bonus that their backline played well, and made no mistakes other than the Benzema goal. Usually, you can expect City’s defense to make some sort of error that leads to them conceding, but last night they were very solid.

      <h10><b>4. Another Tactical Masterclass From Guardiola</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If you had told me before this match that Phil Foden would play as a false nine, I would’ve called you crazy. That is exactly what happened, and it surprised Real Madrid as much as it surprised me. This was just one of Pep Guardiola’s expert tactical moves that he made in this match, and they all paid off. Probably the most important strategy Guardiola implemented into his team was the high press. With Sergio Ramos suspended, and Marcelo not expected to start, Pep told his front 5 to press Real Madrid’s backline as hard as possible, as he knew they would make mistakes that City could capitalize on.

      <h10><b>5. Next up for City: Lyon</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Next Saturday, City will face Lyon in Lisbon, in the quarterfinals of the Champions League. While they will be relieved that they will not be facing Cristiano Ronaldo’s Juventus (who were beaten on away goals by Lyon), this will still be a serious test for the Cityzens. City’s defense will have to cope with the dangerous Memphis Depay, who, as a former Manchester United player, will want to draw blood against his former rivals. No matter how well Lyon play, this is a match Manchester City should win. If they fail to do so, it will be seen as one of the club’s biggest disappointments, as they are one of the favorites to win the Champions League.
