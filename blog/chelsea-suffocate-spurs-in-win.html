      <h12><b>Final Score: Tottenham 0-1 Chelsea</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite being a close game, this was ultimately a dull London Derby as both Tottenham and Chelsea struggled to create good chances. A penalty by Jorginho in the 24th minute meant Chelsea could see the game out in their controlled, conservative setup, and the Blues walked away from this matchup with three points. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Chelsea’s New Setup Creates Control, Not Fireworks</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In his first few games as Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has his team playing a very conservative, controlled game much like what we saw from Manchester City early in the season. It is a good defensive tactic to use this season, as most teams are pressing less than usual, and that means Chelsea are going to have an easier time controlling games. While they lack the creative passing threats that could turn a system like this into an unbeatable force, for the time being it should work well for them. It might also turn around the fortunes of a player like Jorginho, who was not really a fit for Frank Lampard’s system (if you can even call it that), but can thrive playing in a team that dominates possession and needs a player who can cycle the ball like him. This Chelsea team still has a long way to go to get back to the top, but early signs under Tuchel are promising.

      <h10><b>2. There Is No Replacement For Harry Kane</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I said when Harry Kane went down injured against Liverpool that Spurs would really struggle if he was going to be out a long time. I ended up being spot on, as Spurs have not only lost their last two games, but they have had severe struggles on offense in both games. We can look at some numbers to see why this is. Tottenham have been overreliant on Kane this season. While his attacking usage rate (an estimate of possessions that end in shots that go through him) under Pochettino dropped to as low as 14%, this seasons Kane’s attacking usage is all the way up to 24%. On top of that, he accounts for roughly 53% of Tottenham’s expected goals when he is on the field. No one else at the club reaches near those figures. With no one to replace the output or shoulder the extra burden in Kane’s absence, Tottenham’s offense is going to continue to struggle until he comes back.

      <h10><b>3. Callum Hudson-Odoi Is The Playmaker That Makes This System Work</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While teams can win the way Chelsea have been trying to play under Tuchel, it is often hard to score goals when using possession as a defensive tactic. Players start to make the conservative play their first choice, and usually one or two players have to take on most of the creative burden themselves. It kind of worked for Chelsea under Sarri with Eden Hazard, but if Chelsea continue to play that way, they will need a player or two with output like Hazard’s to thrive. Thankfully, they have that in Callum Hudson-Odoi. The attacking midfielder has been excellent in his limited minutes this season, and against Tottenham he acted as their main play driver and biggest creative threat. Christian Pulisic is a similar player that could add more goal threat, and perhaps introducing them both to the starting lineup could ease the burden on one and create a better offense.

      <h10><b>4. Mourinho Has Failed</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Jose Mourinho was always going to be a short-term option as a manager. He is known for winning a lot of trophies, but for him to do that, the team needs to be ready to challenge by at least his second year. Looking at this squad now, it is clear to see Mourinho is not going to win anything at Spurs. The current core hit their peak a few seasons ago, and after the Champions League Final appearance, Tottenham was going to have a period of transition. Which is why it was so baffling that they went and hired Mourinho to be the head coach. After a season and a half of Mourinho, the team looks tired, sluggish, and ultimately not good enough to do what Mourinho wants to do. The defense has improved under him, but the offense has regressed so much that it does not even matter. Mourinho is not getting anything more from this team. He needs to leave before he burns bridges or puts Tottenham farther away from challenging than they already are.

      <h10><b>5. Plenty Still At Stake For These Teams</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Though the teams met today outside of the top four, there is still plenty to play for for both. Chelsea are still in the fight for a Champions League place, just four points behind Liverpool and a fairly easy schedule coming up. They will need to make up as much ground in these next couple of months as they can as they finish the season with a tough stretch of Manchester City away, Arsenal, Leicester, and Aston Villa away. Tottenham are also still in the Champions League race, seven points behind Liverpool with a game in hand, but right now they probably need to focus on damage control. They are going to struggle without Kane, and locking up at least a Europa League group stage spot (5th or 6th) needs to be top priority right now.
