    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 0 - 1 Cadiz</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      A poor Real Madrid side were thoroughly outclassed by newcomers Cadiz, with both sides now tied atop the La Liga table. Here are my five takeaways:

            Coming off of an international break, Zidane had limited choices as to who he could select for the match against Cadiz. He had limited offensive options with injuries to both Eden Hazard and Martin Ødegaard, but that is no excuse to start Lucas Vazquez at right-wing over Marco Asensio (who didn’t take part in Spain’s international matches, so he was fully fit), and Rodrygo (who played well for Brazil during the break). Vazquez added nothing to the squad against Cadiz, and there was a hole on the right side of Madrid’s attack that either Asensio or Rodrygo could’ve filled. In midfield, Zidane once again opted for the double-pivot of Kroos and Modric, which wasn’t any better than the last time Zidane utilized the two in a midfield base (a 0-0 draw with Real Sociedad). Casemiro absolutely must be in this squad for every match, as he is the team’s most important outfield player. He is the only midfielder who can successfully sit in front of the backline and break up opposition counter-attacks. Also, he and Varane are absolutely necessary to balance out Sergio Ramos’ offensive tendencies, as well as cover for the Spaniard’s occasional mistakes (one of which today led to Cadiz’s goal). Finally, Marcelo is not fit to start matches like this anymore; matches where the opposition presses high and doesn’t give him room to maneuver. He was once again a liability at the back, and Zidane should’ve known this was a Ferland Mendy-esque game.

    <h10><b>2. But That Doesn’t Take Away From How Good Cadiz Were</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Cadiz did everything right against Real Madrid. They came into the game flying and caught Real Madrid out early. Then, once they had a lead, they knew the perfect way to stifle Real Madrid’s attack: they packed their whole team (except for Alvaro Negredo and Choco Lozano/Filip Masbasic who stayed up top to threaten Real Madrid’s lone center backs) into their penalty area whenever Madrid had possession, keeping them from creating any sort of chances at goal. Real Madrid thrives off of counter-attacks, and when Cadiz slowed them down and made them try and break down their defensive unit, Los Blancos stood no chance at scoring.

    <h10><b>3. Real Madrid’s Forwards Again Lack That Finishing Touch</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It was Real Madrid’s lack of flexibility that lost them the match against Cadiz, as they couldn’t find the back of the net despite keeping 75% possession. They couldn’t get the ball into the box, forcing them to resort to crosses (which no one aside from Benzema has the chance to get on to, as he was the only one making runs), or taking long shots.  Somehow, Real Madrid need to make a change to their style. They no longer have the pace of Gareth Bale or Cristiano Ronaldo to drive the ball down the field on counter-attacks. Now, the have Vinicius Jr., who is technically excellent but lacks quality decision making, Asensio, who is wildly inconsistent in his performances, and Eden Hazard, who is almost never fit. Real Madrid must adapt to their strengths and learn to find goals directly from possession. They have one of the best groups of midfielders in the world, but that means little when the forwards can do nothing with the midfield’s deliveries. I don’t know how to solve this issue (aside from working in Luka Jovic to be the new starting forward, because he has the ability as a young player to adapt to a new style), and I don’t envy Zidane’s position at the moment.

          Cadiz now sit atop the La Liga table, level on points with Real Madrid. They have won 3 of their 6 matches so far this season, beating heavyweights Athletic Club and Real Madrid. The way they play just works so well for the squad they have; disciplined defense and organized attack and a deep desire to win. They remind me of a 2019/2020 Sheffield United side. It will be interesting to see if they can maintain their hot streak, or if they will eventually taper off. The main threat to the squad at this point is injuries, and if too many of their players end up on the sidelines, this team’s fate could change quite drastically.

    <h10><b>5. Next Week’s Clasico Could Go Very Poorly For Real Madrid</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Coming into this match, I knew Real Madrid were in for a tough clash. With the many injuries that their side has, all games become much more difficult, not to mention Cadiz being a very tough side to face regardless of injuries. Now, after a loss to the newly-promoted side, how will Real Madrid respond next weekend when they face their biggest rivals and the hottest team in La Liga, FC Barcelona? If they start (and finish) as poorly as they did against Cadiz, I fully expect to see Madrid be humiliated by the Catalans. However, if Zidane pulls off another one of his tactical masterclasses (and actually starts his best lineup), Real Madrid may stand a chance in El Clasico.
