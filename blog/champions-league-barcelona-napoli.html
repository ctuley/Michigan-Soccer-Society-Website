      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Lionel Messi put Barcelona on his back once again as the Catalans (unconvincingly) took care of business against a troublesome Napoli side. Now they have a date with Bayern Munich in the quarterfinal, and they may need a bit more than their Argentine superstar to advance. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Barcelona Are Lucky They Have The Best Player In The World</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Let’s just cut right to it, Barcelona were not good in this game. Yes, Messi’s brilliance propelled them to a 3-1 victory, but as a team performance, the Spanish giants were way less than the sum of their parts. They hardly pressed at all on defense, allowing Napoli to throw men forward without worry. Barcelona was able to use this against them by breaking a few nice counterattacks but had Napoli been a bit better in the final third, Barcelona would have been in deep trouble. In possession, Barcelona’s passing was slow, their movement seemed nonexistent, and overall they just didn’t seem to play with much urgency. An early goal - which may have come after a shove by Clement Lenglet - meant Barcelona were happy to slow the game down and not push on for another until Messi decided it was time to take matters into his own hands. Barcelona did not create many chances and if they didn’t have the best player in the world able to create something from nothing, they would not have won this game.

      <h10><b>2. Napoli Had Their Chances But Couldn’t Take Advantage</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Napoli put plenty of pressure on Barcelona’s backline in this match, but by the time they found their breakthrough - a penalty just before halftime - it was too little too late. Napoli had already gone down three goals, and while that hasn’t been a problem for teams against Barcelona in the past, with the poor rate at which they were taking their chances in the first half it was unlikely they would find two more goals. Napoli even started and finished the second half well, creating not only a lot of chances but a handful of really good ones too. Unfortunately for them, the Italian club was too sloppy in the final third to really finish off their dominance of the game. Once Arek Milik had a goal disallowed for being offside with ten minutes to go, you just knew it wasn’t going to be Napoli’s night.

              Barcelona pride themselves on being “more than a club”, but the second leg against Napoli - and really most of this season - showed that this may no longer be true. Barcelona are as far as they’ve ever been from the unit that Pep Guardiola dominated Europe with a decade ago. Under Guardiola, Barcelona thrived because they not only had some of the best individual players on the planet, but they played as a tight, cohesive group. Now, despite having a wealth of outstanding talent that still includes some players from the Guardiola era, Barcelona look like a disjointed mess. Messi was always their talisman, but that has now turned into Argentina-level over-reliance. This reliance on individual talent is unsustainable, especially as all of their best players start to hit the other side of their peak. Barcelona may look to bring in one or two superstars to combat their stagnation, but nothing is going to be fixed until they start playing as a team again. Until then, they’ll just be treading water.

      <h10><b>4. Napoli Make Changes Too Late To Make A Difference</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Around the hour mark, Napoli really started to slow down. Their movement wasn’t as quick, they weren’t creating as much space, and they just looked like they needed a spark. They had that on the bench in players like Hirving Lozano and Arek Milik - the latter of whom would have been an excellent help in Napoli’s crossing game. However, manager Gennaro Gattuso did not make any changes at that time and instead waited until the 70th and 80th minutes to bring each player on respectively (plus another two). When they came one, each player looked good and had the two most dangerous chances of the second half. Lozano had a free header in the box that he couldn’t direct on target and Milik scored that offsides goal I mentioned earlier. Had they been brought on earlier, perhaps they could have had a bigger impact, but Gattuso will have to settle for it being a learning moment in his third season managing at the top level.

      <h10><b>5. Don’t Expect Barcelona To Get Past Bayern Munich</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If Barcelona play like they did against Napoli in the quarterfinal against Bayern Munich, they will get steamrolled. Not only will Bayern be relentless in attack, creating even more and better chances than Napoli were able to, but they won’t be nearly as wasteful. If Robert Lewandowski - who scored and assisted twice in Bayern’s 4-1 win against Chelsea - is given the tiniest chance by Barcelona’s defense, he will punish them. Quique Setien will need to take control of his team and completely rethink his tactics for the only quarterfinal between two superclubs. However, if the past 12 months are anything to go by, the Bayern machine will roll on through to the semifinal.
