      <h12><b>Final Score: Paris Saint-Germain 1 - 2 Manchester United </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        2020 has been a mess and honestly, the return of the UEFA Champions League is all we needed. Granted it wasn’t a classic night of European football, the showpiece fixture of the first mathday delivered in exciting fashion as the Red Devils of Manchester came up against the pride of Paris. The stakes were high, the margins for error were small and the motivations for each player were different. Were Angel Di Maria or Ander Herrea able to haunt the team that let them go, or did Paul Pogba stroll into his hometown with his new look and roll PSG over? Was it another Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes show or did Neymar and Mbappe twist a topsy-turvy United backline inside out? Were PSG able to avenge the ghosts of their previous meeting with United, or was it simply another case of Déjà Vu?

      <h10><b>1. No ‘I’ in Team </b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If there was ever a game that represented the importance of a team's individual brilliance, it was the one that took place in Paris, last night. Manchester United capped off a good day’s work as they ran out as deserved winners of their first game back in Europe’s elite competition. While fans were quick to draw parallels between Marcus Rashford’s penalty on ‘that’ night and his winning goal yesterday, what stood out was the similarity in United’s team performance on both nights. Every Red Devil left the Parc Des Princes last night with their head held high. David De Gea thwarted everything that was thrown at him, and would have had two well deserved clean sheets in two games had it not been for Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial. Axel Tuanzebe provided United with some much needed athleticism at the back and he along with Aaron Wan-Bissaka mitigated any danger created by the likes of Mbappe and Neymar. Alex Telles reminded the Old Trafford faithful what good set piece delivery looks like with an impressive debut, Fred and Scott Mctominay bossed the midfield, much like they did in the 2019 game and Bruno Fernandes captained the team with the drive and intensity he always brings. Both teams were missing key personnel, but the team that defended with 11, rather than the team that defended with 4, was the one that came out on top.

      <h10><b>2. Momentum Is Key</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It is astonishing what confidence can do to a player. Two weeks ago Aaron Wan-Bissaka had come off a 6-1 loss to Spurs, looked like he was 6th or 7th in the pecking order of England right-backs and was starting to feel like a liability. Fast forward to last night and he has scored his first senior goal and dropped the kind of performance many would argue none of England’s right backs could do at the moment against a side like PSG. United fans were served a dish of prime Wan-Bissaka last night as he timed every sliding tackle to the T and made some crucial last minute blocks. It may be premature, but last night would suggest that Wan-Bissaka is back to his best and it’s not just him. Alex Telles looked like he’d been wearing the shirt for years and David De Gea reminded his critics just what he is capable of. This United side have had several memorable performances since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took over, but the consistency has never quite set in. If United and Ole are to come out of October and these next few fixtures unscathed, they’re going to have to build on last night’s showing. If not, things could turn sour quickly. After all, it’s Manchester United, every time they lose it’s a crisis.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I don’t think anyone is suggesting that Solskjaer, a manager inexperienced at the highest level of the game, is tactically more astute that Thomas Tuchel. However, the former got his tactics spot on while the latter simply didn’t and one could argue, that is where the game was won and lost. While Tuchel admitted pre-match that United are fantastic in transition, nothing about his game plan suggested that PSG were going to stop the Red Devils. The inexperienced back four, who had never played together before, were holding a dangerously high line, the midfield, albeit bereft with injuries, were completely run over and in the end, too much was left for the electric front three of Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria to do themselves. Bringing on Moise Kean at half time seemed like a good move, since a lot of good deliveries from Mbappe, Kurzawa and Di Maria fell to nobody in the first half, but the Italian was ineffective for the most part. Solskjaer, on the other hand, turned the absence of Harry Maguire and Eric Bailly into a blessing in disguise, as United looked set to absorb the pressure and hit PSG on the break, something Fernandes, Martial and Rashford are devastatingly good at. They might not have been at their clinical best, but they caused the PSG defense all sorts of problems and were eventually rewarded with an extremely well taken goal by Marcus Rashford. Speaking of Rashford, or should I say...

      <h10><b>4. Dr. Marcus Rashford MBE</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The last time a team beat PSG at the Parc Des Princes in the group stage of the Champions League, Marcus Rashford was probably learning how to write in full sentences. Today, at the age of 22, he has scored two late winners at one of the most historic stadiums in Europe and, in the time between those two games, demonstrated all the qualities a world class player requires: Confidence, Determination, Humility and bucket loads of talent. The prefix and suffix in his name, however, are clearly a result of his personality and work off the pitch. Not only does he have national politicians quaking in their boots as he spearheads the fight against child hunger in the UK, the boy from Wythenshawe has matured at an incredibly quick pace. Not only is he respected by people outside of his club, he is slowly filling the void of leaders in the United dressing room, even ending last night with the captain’s armband. His public dismay at the old ‘stick to football’ cliché simultaneously opens himself up to intense scrutiny and criticism should his form dip. By the looks of it, that doesn’t seem to be happening any time soon and as Manchester United’s No. 10 goes from strength to strength, who knows what the future has in store for Rashford. One thing is for sure, Sir Marcus Rashford does have a nice ring to it, and you better get used to it, because you won’t be hearing the end of it for a long, long time.

      <h10><b>5. Group Of Death Comes Alive</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Group H is the unequivocal group of death for this season’s Champions League. While Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir definitely have the odds stacked against them, it is extremely difficult to call which two of the remaining three teams will make it through to the knockout stages. RB Leipzig have started the campaign in red hot form despite the loss of star striker Timo Werner and will view the block of 3 consecutive Champions League gameweeks as a big plus point. United will favour themselves after winning potentially their most difficult game of the group phase and considering they tend to perform better against high quality opposition, they will be confident heading into their fixtures. Finally, a pre-season-less and injury-hit PSG side are still probably favourites to top the group and will look to bounce back quickly against Istanbul next week. Each game in Group H will most likely be interesting, entertaining and as the weeks go by, increasingly nerve-wracking.
