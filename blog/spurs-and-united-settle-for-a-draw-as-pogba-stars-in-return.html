    <h10>Spurs and United Settle for a Draw as Pogba Stars in Return</h10>

    <h12><b>Final Score: Tottenham Hotspur 1 - 1 Manchester United</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Spurs and Manchester United each shared a point in their return to the Premier League as Bruno Fernandes’ penalty won by Paul Pogba cancelled out an electrifying Steven Bergwijn strike. Here are our 5 Key Takeaways from one of the most important games of the season:

    <h10><b>1. A Quiet Night from Harry Kane</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Harry Kane was kept at bay from having any serious threat towards goal. Due to frustration and a lack of service from teammates, Kane’s impact was so nonexistent that it felt like Spurs were playing with a man down at times. The England striker, back from the COVID break and a 4 month long hamstring injury, failed to link up with Erik Lamela and Son Heung-min. Playing with his back towards goal for most of the time and being forced to use his heading ability for defending corners and crosses rather than getting on the end of them, Kane failed to muster a single shot in the game. By the 70th minute, he seemed totally gassed out and should have been substituted.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Kane has had a lackluster campaign so far. However this season, with the loss of Eriksen to Inter, we saw him forced to drop down to play a deeper role which diminished his goal return. His previous partnership with Dele Alli never fully was put back into action this season, and it is yet to be seen what the primary reason of his decline in form is: his own ability or him never being fed the same amount of chances to convert. Whatever it might be, today was a day to forget for the number 9, whose return the Spurs faithful so eagerly anticipated.

    <h10><b>2. The Pogba-Fernandes Midfield Partnership Looks Promising</b></h10>

            We saw glimpses of the creativity Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes were able to provide today. After the signing of Bruno Fernandes for 67.6M pounds in the January transfer window from Sporting CP, Man United fans were hopeful that his presence, along with Pogba’s, could inject creativity and goal-scoring from midfield. While Fernandes had entered the Premier League with a bang, racking up 2 goals and 3 assists and winning the Player of the Month in February, Pogba was sidelined with complications from an ankle injury since December amidst concerns about his future at the club. United spearheaded by Fernandes were on an impressive 10 game unbeaten run before the COVID break and looked to continue that momentum. This game finally showed us a small preview of what Fernandes and Pogba could bring to United.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            United brought even more attacking power onto the field with Pogba’s introduction in the 63rd minute, which clearly paid off. Pinning Spurs to their own half, United dominated the shots on target tally 6 to 3 and in expected goals 1.77 to 0.53 (understat.com). Fernandes’ linkup play with Anthony Martial created 2 dangerous opportunities before Pogba finally broke the deadlock after being dragged down by Eric Dier in the penalty box for Fernandes to convert. Pogba’s presence and passing- including a pinpoint crossfield pass that almost setup Marcus Rashford 1 on 1- caused many problems for Spurs.

    <h10><b>3. A Good Defensive Display from Spurs - Apart from the Penalty.</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In what was a perhaps, very underwhelming performance from Spurs today, the only positive was the defensive display today. The defensive performance, which had its own problems in Aurier, wasn’t particularly the best, but along with some bad luck on United’s part it denied the Solskjaer’s men a victory today. Sissoko provided another great performance today, proving how he is undroppable, with a couple of key tackles and dispossessing United’s attack wherever he could. Davinson Sanchez was vital in containing the pace of Martial, Rashford, and James. Dier also shined today, with a lot of crucial clearances, but his contributions were overshadowed by the reckless challenge which provided a penalty for Bruno Fernandes to convert.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      But the best showing by a Spurs player was the captain Lloris himself. With a couple of out-of-the-world saves including a stopping Rashford’s close-range attempt and tipping Martial’s shot that was heading for the top corner, the World Cup winner showed Spurs supporters that he is still capable of performing at the highest level. He was vital in Spurs snatching a point from what was a very good game from the visitors.

    <h10><b>4. David De Gea is not what He Once was</b></h10>

          <h13>
            Although Bergwijn’s goal was impressive, David De Gea did himself no favors with his feeble attempt to save it. With Dean Henderson making headlines at Sheffield United, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was recently tipped to have a headache for his goalkeeper selection next season as the loanee returns. De Gea however eased that headache by turning an easy win to a draw. With recent goals conceded by United almost having a De Gea hand in it always - United’s great run of form could be brought onto its knees by none other than their own goalkeeper. Ever since Spain’s 3-3 draw with Portugal in the 2018 World Cup, De Gea has been showing signs of decline. Also with Kepa Arrizabalaga eluding him from the No. 1 spot in the Spanish National Team, the once invincible keeper who single-handedly kept United in games is now a liability at times with his frequent errors. Unfortunately for the previously best United player, it appears that there is a better choice at home than him. But who knows, perhaps some competition from Dean Henderson might bring him back to his best?

    <h10><b>5. Is Jose the Right Person for Spurs? Dissecting the Choices he Made for Spurs Today</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Today Jose Mourinho’s tactics raised more questions than answers for Spurs. Starting from his reluctance to bring on substitutes and stick to his usual hate of certain players to his certain selection choices in the match, which a notable example would be Harry Winks. Winks had no measurable impact whatsoever on the game and his pre-COVID performances did show a similar trend. In a game where you absolutely need the win, you can’t have the redundancy of the qualities Sissoko and Winks both provide on the pitch without compromising the attack, especially one that has been depleted from the likes of Dele Alli and Lucas Moura. The late introduction of Giovani Lo Celso breathed some life into the game, and even though Tanguy Ndombele might not fit the ideal Mourinho system, his creativity was missed in the game as the only chances Spurs had were just from bad mistakes on United’s end.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b>“I had no bench to react to it!” - Mourinho after the match.</b>
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      When United brought on Pogba and Ighalo in, United pressed more ferociously and dominated the game even more, which they took control of from the start. Spurs, who never really had an influence on the game, looked tired and were totally being exploited by the change in United’s game. While Mourinho’s classic excuse to an inadequate performance might have some merit in it this time with the lack of Alli and Moura, his persistence with not giving Troy Parott or Ryan Sessegnon a crack definitely contributed to a lacklustre Spurs attack today, with Kane being out of steam in the early 70s. And with his personal dislike over Ndombele, with his starting lineup and United’s reinforced midfield, it never looked like Spurs were ever going to assert anything in the game. His personal vendettas cost Spurs today, and in classic Mou style we were treated to a boring, boring display of football from what was, once a club known for their great attacking style. It was rather a De Gea mistake rather than a Spurs performance which denied United a well deserved win today.
