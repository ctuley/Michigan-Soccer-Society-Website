      <h12><b>Final Score: RB Leipzig 2-1 Atletico Madrid</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        An interesting tactical battle was expected prior to the match and the match delivered as Julian Nagelsmann found a way to unlock Diego Simeone’s tight defense and saw Leipzig through to the semifinal against PSG. Though it was a stalemate early on, the game was opened up by a couple of substitutes, with young American midfielder Tyler Adams coming off the bench and scoring a late winner. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Leipzig Show The System Is More Important Than The Players</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When it came out that Timo Werner wasn’t going to be available for the rest of Leipzig’s Champions League campaign, it seemed a lot of people immediately wrote the German club off. The loss of their leading goalscorer and the challenge of facing two-time finalists Atletico Madrid - who had just knocked out champions Liverpool - was always going to be a tough prospect. Leipzig were going to need to be at their best for this quarterfinal, as they have struggled this season to break down teams that defend deep like Atletico. Nagelsmann decided to trust his normal fluid, attacking approach that had been used to great success so far this season, and it paid off. Leipzig switched between a 4-2-3-1 in defense and a 3-4-3 narrow diamond in possession, and the personnel chosen gave Nagelsmann plenty of room to tweak as he saw fit - even switching to a 4-4-2 and a 5-4-1 at times. Leipzig’s set-up allowed them to pack the midfield to control the middle while also having players exploiting the space left out wide by Atletico’s compact defense. Leipzig were in control for most of this game, and once they got that first goal, it looked very unlikely that Atletico were going to be able to turn it around. Despite a number of talented players, it was Nagelsmann’s system that really won Leipzig this game.

      <h10><b>2. Joao Felix Changes The Game, So Why Didn’t He Start?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Atletico looked hopeless before Joao Felix came on in the 58’, both because they were doing nothing but defending and because a front two of a not-very-dynamic Diego Costa and midfielder Marcos Llorente were unable to trouble Leipzig’s backline. Once Felix came on, he immediately caused trouble by dropping in between the lines and running at pace. He was the cause of Atletico’s only goal, driving forward into the box and forcing a foul that led to him scoring a penalty. He was by far Atletico’s best player, and it really makes you wonder why he didn’t start. I think Simeone may have wanted to play Llorente in that deeper forward role so he could pack the midfield and be more solid defensively, but Leipzig looked more dangerous when Atletico were sitting back and defending so it seems Simeone just got this one wrong. Happens to the best of us, but he’ll surely be disappointed in his tactics when he knows a different approach may have changed the result.

      <h10><b>3. Upamecano Shows Why So Many Clubs Want Him</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
    Dayot Upamecano was very impressive against Atletico Madrid and showed just why he’s so coveted around Europe. His aggressiveness allowed him to step forward a stop any counterattacking threat Atletico had early in the game. It also allowed him to go toe-to-toe with Diego Costa and never come under threat from the physical Spanish forward. Though his aggressiveness did leave him exposed a couple of times - nearly conceding a penalty in the second half before it was shown to be a dive from Renan Lodi - overall it benefitted him against a very physical Atletico team. His quality in possession was also on display as he ventured forward into space on numerous occasions and used his long passing to spray long balls wide to Angeliño and Konrad Laimer (later Tyler Adams). He’s recently signed a new contract with Leipzig, so it’ll take a hefty fee to pry him away, but whoever opens up the checkbook is getting a sensational talent.

      <h10><b>4. Leipzig Could Give PSG Trouble</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Even though PSG struggled for a good chunk of their quarterfinal against Atalanta, it seems strange to think that they would struggle against another underdog in Leipzig when they’ll have Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria back from the start. It’s weird that a team as attacking as Leipzig would play better against stronger opposition, but that might be the case. Leipzig’s biggest struggles this year have been in trying to unlock tight, deep defenses, which is why they’ve drawn so many games in the Bundesliga but only lost four. Against the top teams though, Nagelsmann seems to know how to shut them down. Leipzig have drawn twice with Bayern Munich this season, and their ability to play on the counterattack makes it dangerous for opponents to give them space in behind. We saw PSG struggle building from deep against Atalanta’s high press, and Leipzig are one of the best pressing teams in Europe. Don’t be surprised if we see PSG struggle against Leipzig (at least for a bit).

      <h10><b>5. RB Leipzig Is Not “Bad For The Sport”</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      At least, no worse for the sport than any current superclub. It’s an unpopular opinion, I know, but hear me out. Yes, they’re owned (and branded) by a big conglomerate known for their energy drinks. Yes, they were only founded in 2009 and bankrolled their way to the top. However, I tend to disagree with this notion that they are “bad for the sport”. Maybe it’s my familiarity with American professional sports making me comfortable with teams feeling more like corporations than communities, but I’m not nearly as bothered by it as some people. They are one of the most well-run clubs around, they prop up an area of Germany that’s very underrepresented at the highest level, they’ve got an exciting group of young players, the best young manager in the game, and they’re really fun to watch. I just don’t see how you can say they’re any worse for the sport than any other team left in the Champions League (bar Lyon).
