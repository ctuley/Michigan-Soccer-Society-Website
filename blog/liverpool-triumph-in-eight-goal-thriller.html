    <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool 5 - 3 Chelsea</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Liverpool got off to a fast start and then held off a Chelsea comeback in a bounce back victory after last week’s loss to Arsenal. The Reds lifted the Premier League trophy for the first time at Anfield. Here are five key takeaways:

            Chelsea’s victory over Manchester City on June 25th clinched the title for Liverpool and the scenes afterwards were raucous. Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold were plastered on Sky Sports, Jurgen Klopp started crying and the dance party was a sight to see. The Reds faced Manchester City in their next match and lost 4-0 and then followed that up with a mystifying 2-1 defeat at Arsenal.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
          The internet mocked Liverpool’s uncharacteristic slip-ups and it was bizarre to see the champions playing so listlessly. But tonight was a different story — Liverpool knew they would be lifting the trophy at home tonight and they put in a performance that reflected their title-winning season.
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Naby Keita fired Liverpool into the lead with a bar-down strike in the 23rd minute. At the end of the first half Alexander-Arnold curled in a brilliant free kick and Georginio Wijnaldum volleyed home a failed clearance to add to Chelsea’s misery. Goals from Roberto Firminho and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the second half sealed the victory.

    <h10><b>2. Pulisic Stars Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>



          <h13>

Manager Frank Lampard made the ill-advised decision not to start Christian Pulisic. Lampard wasn’t satisfied with his front three of Mason Mount, Olivier Giroud and Willian so he made a triple substitution in the 59th minute bringing on Pulisic, Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
Pulisic made an immediate impact in the 61st minute. He split two Liverpool defenders then megged Joe Gomez before sliding a cross to the waiting Abraham who tapped it in. Twelve minutes later, a Chelsea long throw was flicked past the Liverpool back line before Hudson-Odoi crossed to the waiting Pulisic. The American winger settled the ball on his chest before turning and shooting the ball into the roof of the net.
It was an astonishing impact off the bench and will make Lampard think twice before leaving him out of the lineup again. Pulisic now has nine goals and six assists in the Premier League this season including four after the restart. He has arguably become Chelsea’s best player and his services will be needed for the Blues to win against Wolves on Sunday.

    <h10><b>3. Chelsea’s Champions League Hopes In Precarious Position</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The reversal of the Champions League ban on Manchester City made the top-four race more interesting. If Chelsea had beat Liverpool they would have automatically qualified for the Champions League. Their loss leaves them in fourth place and tied with Manchester United on points with 63 (Manchester United have the goal difference lead). The Blues are one point ahead of Leicester City who play Manchester United on Sunday. If Chelsea win or draw against Wolves they will automatically qualify for the Champions League, if they lose then Manchester United will need to beat Leicester to ensure qualification. Wolves have Europa League qualification hopes of their own, they are currently in sixth place and will be highly motivated on Sunday.

      The Premier League format on the final day sees all 20 teams in action with 10 games all starting at 11 AM ET. This final day should be one to remember with the relegation battle and European qualification still up for grabs.

          Chelsea had a legitimate comeback bid going in the second half when they cut the lead to 4-3. A classic Liverpool counter attack ended with a tap-in goal and iced the game for the champions. In 2019/20 Chelsea have been a Jekyll and Hyde sort of team. They have scored 67 goals, 3rd best in the league and conceded 54, 8th worst in the league. Their back line is much maligned. Center backs Kurt Zouma, Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rudiger and César Azpilicueta (in a three back system) have not inspired confidence this season. Chelsea have already spent over $100 million on attackers Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech this transfer window. That figure could balloon to $180 million if the purchase of Kai Havertz is completed. The question is, why aren’t Chelsea addressing their defense?
        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          I think by now the problem is quite obvious to the Chelsea hierarchy, but is billionaire owner Roman Abramovich willing to spend more? The club may be able to fund transfers by selling some of their own players, including some of the aforementioned center backs.
Chelsea fans are high on West Ham CDM/CB Declan Rice, he has shown his potential to play in the back line and he could become the anchor in the way that Harry Maguire has been at Manchester United. It will be interesting to see how the Blues address their holes in the back, if they want to compete for the Premier League title they will need to make several squad changes this summer.

    <h10><b>5. Liverpool Showcase Their Depth In Midfield</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Liverpool may have endured a poor spell of form after the restart but they showed today the many ways they can hurt the opposition. Naby Keita, who has yet to fully reach expectations on Merseyside, showed why Liverpool fans want him to get more game time. Keita pressured Willian into a turnover, Keita then took one dribble and fired a missile past the goalkeeper. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made a substitute appearance, filling in at right wing and scored the dagger. He usually plays in the center of the midfield but is capable of playing more advanced as well. Oxlade-Chamberlain and Keita usually don’t get much game time at Liverpool but both would slot right in to every Premier League side except maybe Manchester City.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
    Curtis Jones made a substitute appearance as well and Klopp seems very high on the youngster who has made three appearances since the restart. They also have Marko Grujic (on loan at Hertha Berlin), Ben Woodburn and Harry Wilson for the future. I have criticized Liverpool for their lack of depth in other areas but it seems like they have a bright future in the midfield with several academy products and young players.
