    <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester City 3 - 0 Arsenal</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Manchester City takes advantage of Arsenal’s continued defensive deficiencies with goals from Sterling, de Bruyne, and Foden. David Luiz headlines for all the wrong reasons. Here are the five key takeaways.

    <h10><b>1. Kevin de Bruyne Strengthens His Case for Football’s Best Midfielder</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      De Bruyne has proven time and again that he can truly do it all, and he once again ran the show in the middle of the park against Arsenal. He effortlessly sprayed balls from one end of the pitch to the other, sliced the backline with perfectly weighted through balls, and controlled the speed of play. De Bruyne showcased his unmatched awareness of the pitch and his combination of vision, technique, and timing which is second to none. His man-of-the-match-worthy performance was deservedly capped with a goal from the penalty spot in the 51st minute before being subbed off soon after.

          <h13>
            With a defensive record and back-line already mocked, the Gunners now face bigger issues. Granit Xhaka suffered a severe ankle injury just four minutes into play causing the midfielder to be stretchered off. Pablo Marí, who started at center-back alongside Shkodran Mustafi, picked up a hamstring injury just 15 minutes later, forcing Arsenal to use their second substitution far earlier than planned. David Luiz was brought on to replace Marí, and it took only 23 minutes for Luiz to fulfill his reputation for committing mental errors. After mistiming a clearance, Raheem Sterling had no trouble slotting away City’s first goal. Two minutes later, Luiz recklessly brought down Riyad Mahrez in the box, earning himself a red card and gifting Kevin de Bruyne a goal from the spot. A minute later, Mustafi, the only remaining available center-back in the entire squad, picked up a slight injury of his own, although he carried on, allowing Arsenal fans to breathe a sigh of hesitant relief.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Arsenal’s long-lasting center-back dilemma has not improved, and a combination of injury and disciplinary issues against Manchester City only made it worse. Mikel Arteta will be eager for Frechman William Saliba to arrive later this summer and may look to spend big on another center-back before the start of next season.

    <h10><b>3. Manchester City: A Perfect Match for “Project Restart”</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Like most football leagues around Europe, the Premier League has returned with a few wrinkles and rule changes. Most notable is the increased substitution limit from three to five, allowing teams to make more personnel changes than normal given the revised, condensed schedules that they face. No team is better suited for this change than Manchester City, who boast the deepest squad in England, and possibly in the world.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Over the past few seasons, City has bulked up its squad to the point that it could field two entirely unique teams which could each challenge for the Premier League title. Against Arsenal, City only added insult to injury by spending second-half substitutions on Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden, Rodri, Fernandinho, and Sergio Aguero—already with a two-goal lead. This, combined with a superb fitness level, allowed City to remain sharp and maintain a world-class quality of play until the final whistle.
    </h13>

<!-- 4th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Bernd Leno is a Top Class Goalkeeper</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Putting in another performance of the highest order, Bernd Leno shined against an onslaught of Manchester City attacks as he recorded 8 saves. With the third-highest save percentage in the Premier League this season and his ability to oftentimes single-handedly keep Arsenal competitive, very few goalkeepers can be regarded more highly. Despite conceding three goals, one of which a penalty, Leno stood out and was a dominating presence.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Arsenal keeper is mirroring the role that David de Gea has played at Manchester United for several years: the savior amidst a seemingly helpless squad. Arsenal owes Leno credit for much of its recent success—or at least for preventing complete capitulation.
    </h13>

<!-- 5th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. The Future of Arsenal’s Front Three is a Coin Toss</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Albeit a good problem to have, the Gunners have far too many attacking options to fit into just three spots. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been the only consistent starter in the front three this season and was deployed on the left-wing against City. Bukayo Saka, who sees his future on the wing, took up the right flank, while emerging youngster Eddie Nketiah led the lineup front. On paper, this front three is deadly, but a glance over to the bench raises some eyebrows.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Arsenal’s £72 million record signing Nicolas Pépé was the biggest name left out of the starting XI (and he was never brought on, either). Gabriel Martinelli and Reiss Nelson, two promising teenage wingers, have both struggled for consistent playing time and only the latter was given a few minutes against Manchester City. Alexandre Lacazette may have the most to worry about given the prestige his name carries yet his exclusion from the lineup in such a crucial match.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Mikel Arteta is still figuring out his preferred front three, but until then, the seven options will continue to be shuffled on a weekly basis.
