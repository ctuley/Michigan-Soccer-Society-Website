    <h13>
      It’s the end of another Premier League season, and that means three more unlucky teams will be playing their soccer in the second division next season. Unfortunately for relegated teams these days, dropping down doesn’t just mean the club is missing out on top tier competition. With the ridiculous amount of money brought in by Premier League clubs through TV deals, relegated clubs are losing a massive revenue stream for their season(s) in the Championship. As a result, a massive offloading of high-wage players often follows relegation. This offers the top clubs a chance to find talented players at a discounted price. Liverpool, for example, did this when they signed Georginio Wijnaldum from Newcastle in 2016, Andy Robertson from Hull in 2017, and Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke in 2018. There’s value to be found in Bournemouth, Watford, and Norwich’s squads. Let’s see what we can find:

    <h10><b>Bournemouth:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>David Brooks (Position: FWR, MR, AMC; Age: 23; Value: €24 million)</b><h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I’m not going to talk about Nathan Ake in the Bournemouth section because he’s likely to go for €40-50 million, and I don’t think he’s worth that much. There just isn’t much value in that for me. So instead, I’ll try to highlight some players that I think could be undervalued.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The first is midfielder David Brooks, who actually spent most of last season out with injury. I’m always a little hesitant to look at players who have just had a long injury layoff because you’re never totally sure how it’s affected them physically and mentally. But, on the other hand, these players can represent great value as wider interest may not be as high in them after missing nearly an entire season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I think Brooks can be a real asset to any team that signs him, especially a team in need of some creativity in their midfield. He ranks well above average in most creative metrics, including above the 80th percentile in expected assists and passes into the penalty area. He also brings a bit of a goal threat, despite not getting off a ton of shots. Brooks ranks just under the 80th percentile in non-penalty expected goals per 90 and per shot, which means his movement and positioning are getting him into good areas when he is taking shots. He’s young and there’s a ton of potential for him to take his talents to the next level. A top club might want to take a chance on him if they can get him for cheap and offer him a good amount of minutes.
    </h13>

    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Jefferson Lerma (Position: DM, MC; Age: 25; Value: €20 million)</b><h12>

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Colombian international is a solid, aggressive midfield screener, and a player that can move the ball forward and get heavily involved in possession. Offensively, he ranks in the 70th percentile for xGBuildup per 90, but first among the Bournemouth squad showing how important he is to their buildup. His progression numbers are pretty good - ranking slightly above average in progressive passes and just below the 80th percentile for passes into the final third per 90. Defensively, he’s good at winning the ball back via applying pressure to the opposition. He also sweeps up well to collect loose balls - he’s in the 98th percentile for recoveries per 90. Lerma is a good all-round player that could fit in well at a team in need of a defensively active, versatile midfielder.

    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Abdoulaye Doucouré (Position: DM, MC; Age: 27; Value: €20 million)</b><h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league-7.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      A couple of seasons ago, Arsenal fans believed Doucouré was finally the aggressive, box-to-box midfielder they had been needing for years. At 27 years old, he may not be a long-term option for that anymore, but he could still bring some quality to a team that needs a player in that mold. Doucouré was an extremely active presser this season - ranking in the 96th percentile for pressure and 92nd for successful pressures per 90 - especially higher up the field after he moved into the AMC spot under Nigel Pearson. His work rate means he picks up a lot of loose balls - ranking in the 92nd percentile for recoveries per 90. His passing is solid, but he represents a dangerous goal threat through driving into the box from deep - logging 0.16 non-penalty expected goals per 90. Doucouré’s versatility and defensive work rate could be assets for any team in need of short term strengthening of their midfield.

    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Ismaila Sarr (Position: FWR, FW, AMC, MR; Age: 22; Value: €24.5 million)</b><h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league-9.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I’ve been keeping an eye on Sarr since his last season at Rennes, and here’s what I wrote about him before the restart: “A lot of people may not have been aware of him before his brace against Liverpool ended the leaders’ hopes of an invincible season, but his production was good before that game. He ranks in the 91st percentile for non-penalty xG, touches in the box, and shot-creating actions. He also ranks in the 95th percentile for successful dribbles - his main means of progressing the ball. He seems like he’ll be a solid goalscoring wide forward for Watford, all he needs is more minutes.”
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      His end product was a bit lacking post-restart, but I’m still very high on him as he has shown what he’s capable of in the past. He’s a dangerous dribbler and can provide both goal and creative threats. He’s very young, and I still think he will develop further as a goalscoring wide forward in the future.
    </h13>

    <h12><b>Emi Buendia (Position: FWR, MR; Age: 23; Value: €14.5 million)</b><h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league-11.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      For any top team looking to sign €80 million Jack Grealish to add a creative attacking midfielder, might I suggest instead looking at Emi Buendia? The Norwich midfielder has mainly been fielded on the right this season, but he can play anywhere across the front three. His creative metrics are ridiculously good - ranking above the 95th percentile six creative metrics that include shot-creating actions and key passes. He also puts in a lot of work defensively - seen in his 95th percentile ranking for successful pressures. One thing likely making him a bit underrated is his goal threat, which isn’t great. He scored one goal this year, mainly because he takes most of his shots from long range - 0.06 xG per shot - and isn’t nearly as good at shooting from range as Grealish or Fernandes. But that is likely keeping his value down, and if your club isn’t needing goals from him, his creative abilities are too good not to go for him.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league-12.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Ben Godfrey (Position: CB; Age: 22; Value: €11.5 million)</b><h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league/finding-value-in-teams-relegated-from-the-premier-league-13.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: 90MAAT</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The time may have passed to get Godfrey at a reasonable price. Norwich has supposedly slapped a €55 million price tag on him, and interest from Dortmund and RB Leipzig could see the price driven to that. But if Norwich gets into a bind financially, they may be willing to part with him for much less than that.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Dortmund and Leipzig are interested in him for a reason. Godfrey is excellent on the ball and his passing - especially his long passing with an 80.1% completion rate - is one of his best attributes. He’s good in the air - winning about ⅔ of his aerial duels - and his positioning and discipline mean he doesn’t need to be super aggressive in trying to win the ball back. He’s also very quick, which helps when he needs to cover for an attacking fullback or if he is somehow caught out of position. He’s a good center-back for this level despite being just 22 years old, but he’s only going to get better, and he’ll be an excellent long term option for whoever picks him up.
    </h13>
