      <h12><b>Final Score: FC Bayern Munich 5 - 0 Fortuna Düsseldorf</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Rekordmeister pulled off another impressive win against Düsseldorf at a spectator-less Allianz Area, as they go ten points clear of Dortmund (who have a game in hand). Düsseldorf, meanwhile, is in real relegation danger. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Bayern are Even Closer to an 8th consecutive Bundesliga Title</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        At a point in the club’s history where a Bundesliga title is not something which marks a great season but is instead an absolute necessity, Bayern comes closer to the 8th consecutive one. After a disastrous start to this season, winning the Bundesliga didn’t seem so likely. But the season soon turned around, and even with Dortmund, Leverkusen, Gladbach, and Leipzig providing stern competition, Bayern is now 10 points clear at the top of the league. With today’s resounding victory, they proved yet again why they deserve to be crowned champions, and that they are just a league above anyone else in the Bundesliga. Hansi Flick continues the best run by a Bayern manager since Pep Guardiola, with 22 wins in 25 matches, and 80 goals scored in total.

      <h10><b>2. Davies and Pavard - Are they the World’s Best Full-Backs?</b></h10>

              Bayern was absolutely phenomenal out on the pitch today, and with more than 20 shots and 8 on target, their attack was world-class. The key to that attack was their full-backs. With Pavard directly contributing to two goals - the own goal and the spectacular header - his contribution can’t be ignored. With the pace and finishing of an attacker and his defensive qualities, he demonstrated throughout this season why he should be the starting right-back for years to come at Allianz Arena. His opportunities first came through the injury of fellow French World Cup Winner Lucas Hernandez, and he since then managed the second-most number of minutes on the pitch after Joshua Kimmich. His long-range shooting is a testament to his attacking skills - almost replicating his incredible 2018 World Cup goal against Argentina.

      <h13>
        Alphonso Davies - whom Thomas Müller described as the Roadrunner of Bayern - has established himself to be the best left-back in the world this season. With his electric pace, strong tackling, and dazzling footwork, he never fails to set up goals from the left flank, and even scores a couple of amazing goals! His defensive capabilities are often overlooked in favor of his pace and attacking skills, but he never fails to impress. His speed enables him to cover a large area on the left and gets himself into attacking situations fairly often while still being able to trackback. Today’s goal by Davies was simply out of this world - tackling the ball in the penalty box from an opposition player then dribbling his way out to score a well-finished goal.

      <h13>
        This match against Düsseldorf shows how much talent Bayern possess in their ranks, and how well they can link them together on the pitch.

      <h10><b>3. Examining Düsseldorf's Defense Today</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Düsseldorf’s defense today was painful to watch as they hopelessly surrendered to the Rekordmeister’s attack. The only single positive from today’s match is the performance by Kastenmaier, without whom the scoreline could be in the double-digits today. However, even that shows how disastrous the defense was today, with more than 20 shots today by Bayern. An own-goal early in the match signaled the end of all trying by Düsseldorf defenders as they conceded 4 or more goals a third consecutive match against Bayern. With them having 2 clean sheets out of 9 games before this one, this was a very humbling day for Uwe Rosler’s men. With the defenders shying away from the ball, fearing they might get hit by it before conceding a goal from a corner, it simply doesn’t provide a good impression on those defenders.

      <h10><b>4. Can Düsseldorf Survive in the Bundesliga?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With Dusseldorf entering this game on a very positive note, riding a six-game unbeaten run, beating Schalke in the last game, they soon got a taste of the table-leaders Bayern. Their survival in the Bundesliga, however, as odd it might sound, should not be drawn from today’s performance against Bayern, as Bayern are truly an anomaly in the league. Düsseldorf should draw confidence from the previous Schalke game, fix their defensive issues from today, get Thommy creating chances and Karaman continuing his hot run of form and they actually might not end up going down this season.
