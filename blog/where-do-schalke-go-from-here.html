    <h12><b>Final Score: FC Schalke 04 0 - 1 Werder Bremen</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In a lackluster game decided by a moment of brilliance from Leanardo Bittencourt, Werder Bremen defeated Schalke 1-0. Schalke’s performance matched their current run of form, in which they’re winless in their last 11 games and have slowly slipped out of contention for European football. Despite securing a vital victory, Bremen remains in the bottom three and three points behind 17th place Mainz with a game in hand. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Josh Sargent Energetic in Attack and Defense</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Although he failed to score, American forward Josh Sargent offered a lively presence all over the field. Early in the first half, Sargent made a smart run in behind Schalke’s left flank but his cutback was blocked. Sargent did not create any other chances but was key in Bremen’s high first-half possession numbers by spearheading their high press and dropping back and harassing Schalke’s midfielders. Additionally, after Sargent’s strike partner Milot Rashica was injured in the second half, he used his pace to help counteract Schalke’s mounting pressure and slow down the tempo of the match.

    <h10><b>2. Todibo has Star Potential</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Apart from the two goals conceded from corners, Bayern’s defense was absolutely world-class today. Neuer, who finally signed a contract extension earlier this week, proved today why he is still one of the world’s best keepers. Alexander Nubel will still face fierce competition for the first-team spot when he comes in next season. With the number of key saves he made today, and his quality in possession - reminding us of his 2014 World Cup-winning season - it is clear that Nubel would be learning from the best next season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      At times, Schalke center-back Jean-Clair Todibo’s performance resembled that of a far more experienced defender. A very capable dribbler, he was comfortable dribbling into the midfield and consistently shut down Bremen attackers in one v one situations. Playing as the left-sided center back in a back five, Todibo was also able to use his considerable speed to successfully match up against Bremen’s wide attackers. However, in the 32’ minute, Todibo gave away the ball and his turnover led to the game’s only goal. In another moment of recklessness, Todibo ran over Josh Sargent far away from Schalke’s goal and received a yellow card. A product of FC Barcelona, Todibo has been linked to many clubs outside of Germany, and perhaps if he can limit his mistakes, he will become a world-class defender.

    <h10><b>3. Bremen’s Early Game Plan Removed Schalke’s Width</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Exhibiting the desperation of a team fighting relegation, Bremen started the game strongly and dominated the ball in the first half. Each time Schalke won the ball, Bremen immediately pressured as a team and regained control. Deep into the first half, Bremen still had over 70% possession. As a result, Schalke’s wingbacks, Jonjoe Kenny and Juan Miranda were pinned back and unable to attack in wide areas. In response, Schalke switched to a back four after halftime and attempted more crosses into the box. However, Bremen’s collective defending was extremely effective, and Schalke was unable to manufacture any clear cut chances during the match.

    <h10><b>4. Weston McKennie was Schalke’s Driving Force</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Much like the rest of the Schalke team, midfielder Weston McKennie struggled to get on the ball in the first half. After 35 minutes, he was tied for the least amount of touches in the team with 10. Once play resumed in the second half, McKennie was the engine in the middle of a reinvigorated team. He began to impose his physicality and won a series of tackles which allowed him to find his teammates in wide areas. In the 53rd minute, McKennie won the ball in midfield, and sprung a counter-attack which concluded after Jiří Pavlenka stuffed Benito Raman’s shot from a tight angle. However, McKennie, and Schalke’s rejuvenation was cut short when McKennie was substituted after attempting a risky tackle while already on a yellow card. Although McKennie will miss Schalke’s next match due to yellow card accumulation, perhaps after he returns, Schalke can use his tenacious style of play to inspire an end of season push.

    <h10><b>5. Schalke has Lost its Identity</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In the opening stages of this campaign, Schalke relied on a high press to generate attacking opportunities and appeared to have the potential to earn a place in European football for next season. However, much like their other recent games, against Bremen, Schalke was disjointed and ineffective. Despite many substitutions and a mid-game change in formation, Schalke only registered one shot on goal. Even after Schalke gained a larger share of the ball in the second half, their possessions lacked direction, evidenced by multiple instances where a cross was delivered without any Schalke players inside the 18-yard box. Players were too often stagnant without the ball, and Bremen was able to remain compact and shut down attacks through the middle. Without its distinctive high press, Schalke has struggled to score goals, and it seems as if coach David Wagner has no backup plan.
