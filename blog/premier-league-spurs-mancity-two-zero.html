      <h12><b>Final Score: Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 0 Manchester City </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although debatable, you won’t find many people who disagree that the greatest managerial rivalry of the decade just past has been Guardiola vs Mourinho. Their battles in La Liga have gone down in El Classico folklore and while Pep had his adversary’s number during the latter’s stint in Manchester (barring that Paul Pogba inspired comeback), leading into this game, the tables seemed to have turned in the Portugese’s favour. Indeed, after an eventful evening in London, it was the Lillywhites who came out on top.

      <h10><b>1. A Tale of Two Duos</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Since the start of the season it has been well documented that Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son are, how should I put this… on fire! The two frontmen of Tottenham have been in scintillating and frankly unstoppable form with Harry Kane dropping deep and causing havoc. If there’s one thing we have learned from the Amazon documentaries is that both these teams do a considerable amount of analytical work for every game. Now I’m no expert, but I’m sure Pep and his team would have noticed Harry Kane’s movement. Why then have Ruben Dias and Aymeric Laporte, the centre back partnership the City faithful have been eager to see, closed down the Spurs no.9, leaving Son in ample space to be picked out by a resurgent Tanguy Ndombele and slot it past a extremely poorly position Ederson. It was a defensive calamity for City and it was all caused by Harry Kane moving about three yards deep. I don’t know about you, but that’s the best bit of movement I’ve seen all week.

      <h10><b>2. Who Is Man City’s Mr. Reliable?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Vincent Kompany headed back home to Anderlecht at the beginning of the 19/20 season. David Silva is currently tearing it up and flying high at the top of the table with Real Sociedad. Fernandinho has had persistent injury problems and was missing last night as well. Sergio Aguero too finds himself more often on the sidelines than he would like. With this City team missing its stalwarts, most would have turned to Kevn De Bruyne to take up the mantle. While he is, contrary to public opinion, a passionate and outspoken leader, he has found it difficult to hit the ground running this season. A betting man would place his bets on that changing soon and not lose a moment’s sleep over it, but the fact of the matter is that De Bruyne is not turning up for his team when they need it, and they certainly did last night. This Man City team has bucket loads of talent, but it's difficult to find someone they can depend on and De Bruyne’s inability to step up this season could be a major reason as to why they are languishing in 13th.

      <h10><b>3. Signing Of The Season?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I might be the 100th person to say this, but this was vintage Jose. Get an early goal and then make it impossible for the other team to get in behind. While Eric Dier (my man of the match) and Hugo Lloris had fantastic games, the one man who has helped most in this endeavour has been Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. The Danish midfielder has completely transformed this Spurs team and is now one of the first names on Mourinho’s team sheet. Early on in Jose’s stint, Spurs were conceding way too many goals towards the end of games, uncharacteristic of Mourinho sides. Barring the extraordinary turn of events against the Hammers, that has completely changed this season and Hojbjerg is exactly what the Special One has been crying out for, not a ‘good guy’. That picture, probably the best snapshot from the Tottenham Hotspur stadium that night is the epitome of grit and passion. Mourinho got the players he wanted, but this one seems to be working out better than anyone could have imagined. Unfancied and uninspirational at the time, but nobody is asking any questions now.

      <h10><b>4. Rules Rules Rules!</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I’m not going to lie, watching Mike Dean point to exactly that point on his sleeve which is 100% legal and does not count as a handball while the City players argue relentlessly was hilarious (I’m a United fan, there isn’t much to be happy about these days). On a more serious note, what has the game come to? De Bruyne put it perfectly when he pointed out the insistent rule changes from FIFA in recent years and how they haven’t done anything to make the laws of the game more clear and objective. Looking at the Gabriel Jesus incident for the umpteenth time, I still couldn’t tell you if it was a handball or not. Has it touched his leg first? Has it touched him on the sleeve or below it? It’s incredibly difficult to say. Surely if the decision is that difficult, it’s not a clear and obvious decision? These questions have been asked countless times already this season, and will be asked even more times by the time we’re done. It is frustrating to see games be decided on penalties and VAR calls (Man United vs West Brom instantly comes to mind), but that’s the world we live in now.

      <h10><b>5. The Real Deal…?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Right off the bat I am going to say no. The evidence might seem undeniable, but the Premier League has never been this unpredictable and it seems unwise to draw any conclusions at the moment. With three London derbies on the horizon, followed by a visit to the champions and clashes against Leicester and Wolves, this Spurs team could potentially be in a very different position come the turn of the year. However, Mourinho has got what he wanted and seems to have come good on his promise of making Harry Kane and company a force to be reckoned with. Liverpool and Chelsea at the very least are extremely likely to have their say in how this season transpires, but looking at their performances so far, Spurs might just be the real deal and this time, they might just have the bottle to back it up during the run in. Regardless, without meaning any offense, it does feel weird seeing the Lillywhites at the top of the table. If they’re able to remain consistent, however, it is a sight we will have to get used to. 2020, am I right?
