      <h12><b>Final Score: Arsenal 2 - 1 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After dominating the first 30 minutes of play, errors by Liverpool’s Virgil Van Dijk and Alisson led to goals for an Arsenal side who were struggling to keep possession of the ball. Staunch defending and goalkeeping by the Gunners kept Liverpool’s attack at bay in the second half, securing three points for Arsenal and denying the Reds a chance at achieving 100 points this season. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

      <h10><b>1. Arsenal’s Young Talent Shine</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Scoring his first premier league goal, 20 year old Reiss Nelson showed a lot of potential against a tough Liverpool back line. The young forward was instrumental in most of Arsenal’s pushes up the pitch, providing passes forward and weaving around defenders. His goal may not have been the hardest to score, however, he could have easily blasted it over the net or just wide. Nelson’s calm and collected attitude allowed him to drive the ball into the back of the net, ultimately securing the win for the Gunners. 18 year old wonderkid Bukayo Saka continued to wow spectators with his pace and determination. Saka has received a lot of praise from manager Mikel Arteta and subsequently has garnered high expectations for his play. Despite not picking up a goal or assist, Saka’s presence was felt all over the pitch, winning balls back in the defensive half and pushing the attacks forward. Arsenal have some very strong young players in their squad and they will be a fun team to watch going forward.

      <h10><b>2. Liverpool Do Not Look Like the Same Team From February</b></h10>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Following an unprecedented start to the season, Liverpool have slowed down significantly in recent games. Since the season restarted in June their record currently sits at 3-2-2, a rather disappointing stretch of games for Jurgen Klopp’s Reds. Having won the Premier League weeks ago, perhaps the players feel they have nothing left to play for, leading to careless and sloppy play on both sides of the pitch. For a team who has been so polished all season, two big mistakes leading to goals in one game is cause for concern, especially looking to next season as the competition is sure to be closer. Liverpool currently lacks the discipline and clinicality that won them the Premier League this year, and if they hope to defend their title next season, Klopp needs to find a way to motivate his players and bring that unbeatable attitude back to the dressing room.

      <h10><b>3. Arsenal’s Defense Still Needs a Lot of Improvement</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite only allowing one goal in the game, Arsenal’s back line continues to be their weakest point. Allowing 24 shots, 8 of which were on target, the Gunners found themselves a bit lucky to finish the game only allowing Mane’s early goal. Bernd Leno’s backup Emiliano Martinez proved he can hold his own, garnering half a dozen saves and providing solid distribution from the back. 23 year old Kieran Tierney also had a solid game himself, shutting down many of Mo Salah’s runs down the right side. As for Arsenal’s other two defenders, questions remain as to whether they can hold their own going forward. David Luiz has had many problems since the restart, conceding many goals and getting burned by pacey forwards. Rob Holding found himself starting over the usually favored Mustafi, and ran into many problems on the left side with Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson coming at him repeatedly. Arsenal have a lot of attacking talent, however, if they want to contend for the title next season they need to sure up their back line.

      <h10><b>4. Henderson Injury Leaves Liverpool Without Their Leader</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While he may not be the single most talented player for the Reds, there is no denying that Jordan Henderson is their most important player on the pitch. His leadership and unbreakable attitude are instrumental to Liverpool’s success, however, he will not be on the pitch for the remainder of the season. Following a knee injury against Brighton a week ago, Henderson has been ruled out for the remainder of the season, leaving center back Virgil Van Dijk to wear the captain’s armband. While Van Dijk is a strong leader himself, he lacks some of the passion and attitude that are unique to Henderson. It is possible that Liverpool’s sloppy play could in part be attributed to their lack of leadership on the pitch, communicating less and allowing for more mistakes. With the league being won already, Henderson will look forward to raising the trophy at Anfield next week and work his hardest to be back in action at the start of next season.

      <h10><b>5. Mikel Arteta is Turning His Team Around</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After replacing Unai Emery, former Arsenal player Mikel Arteta had his work cut out for him managing the Gunners. In his first seven games in charge, Arteta had won just one game and drawn five, claiming eight points from an available twenty-one. Arsenal was then knocked out of the Europa League in two shocking losses to Olympiakos, essentially killing their chances at playing European football next season. However, following his 1-5-1 start, Arteta has turned things around for Arsenal, garnering seven wins and a draw in their next eleven games. Inheriting a club with large holes, he has utilized young talent to give his team a fighting chance going forward. If he can bring in some big defensive transfers, Arteta’s Gunners could very well be on track to make some noise in the league next season.
