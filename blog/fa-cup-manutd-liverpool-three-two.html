      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 3 - 2 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester United and Liverpool took a break from their ongoing battle at the summit of the Premier League to lock horns in the fourth round of the 140th edition of the Emirates FA Cup. This fixture’s recent history has seldom seen a lot of goals in spite of the rich attacking talent on both sides. Nevertheless, injuries, squad rotation and a pinch of nostalgia meant that this meeting between the two most successful teams in the land will without a doubt go down as a classic.

      <h10><b>1. Manc Born And Bred</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There’s nothing Manchester United fans and players enjoy more than scoring against Liverpool, but when it's a purebred Mancunian that gets on the scoresheet, the feeling is unmatched. Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford, the golden boys of Manchester, each slotted casually past Alisson as United led on the 48th minute mark after going 1-0 down. The equaliser included a Paul Pogba tackle at the edge of his own penalty area, an exquisite crossfield pass from Rashford and a characteristic Greenwood right-foot finish. The second saw Greenwood and Rashford switch roles as United’s first half dominance paid dividends almost immediately after the restart. Both goals: Made. In. Manchester. For two players that are often hounded by mainstream media, especially in the case of 19-year old Greenwood, these goals would have done them a world of good.

      <h10><b>2. Squad Depth, Key</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite these unprecedented times and this unpredictable season, one thing that was always certain was that squad depth would be more important than ever. Both managers rested key personnel in their midweek league fixtures presumably in preparation for this FA Cup tie. Moreover, even the two Starting XIs put out today were not necessarily either team’s strongest. The much sidelined Donny Van De Beek started in place of the mercurial Bruno Fernandes while one third of Liverpool’s famed front three, Sadio Mane, was also left out of the starting XI. United looked the dominant force for the majority of the game and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can owe that to how energetic his team looked in comparison to their Merseyside counterparts. This is not only down to Liverpool’s injury woes, which of course were a significant factor, but down to how well Ole has managed and rotated his squad throughout the season. United haven’t had too many long term injuries this season and it’s no secret why. With the league as competitive as it is, the FA Cup poses the best chance at a trophy for several teams and squad depth could prove pivotal in that endeavour.

      <h10><b>3. Back In The Goals</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It is tough to be optimistic about Liverpool right now, but this game did offer up a few positives. Although they are searching for their first win in six (and first in nine if you discount the game against the Aston Villa U-23s in the previous round of this competition), they did manage to end at least one unwanted record tonight. The Reds found the back of the net for the first time in five games, both goals in this match coming from their talisman, Mo Salah. Even if the goals were for a losing cause, they came at an opportune moment for the Egyptian who had been looking bereft of any ideas in the last few games. However, Liverpool’s No. 11 scored two excellent goals tonight, the first of which was a lovely dink over an on rushing Dean Henderson that gave his team the lead within the first eighteen minutes of the game. Liverpool fans will be hoping that he can carry these goals into the next few Premier League games, a period that could be season defining for the champions.

      <h10><b>4. Mentality And Maturity</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        A lot has been made of Manchester United’s inability to step up in the big games this season. Indeed, this was their first win against the traditional Top 6 in seven attempts this season. Add to that their disappointing performances in the last two gameweeks of the UEFA Champions League group stage and you can see why this young squad’s mentality has been questioned. Nevertheless, Ole and his team have shown that significant progress is being made and their recent purple patch has led to them being lauded as ‘mentality monsters’, and the numbers back it up. United have 21 points from losing positions in the league this season, which is 11 more than the next best team. Players like Rashford and Luke Shaw are exhibiting the type of maturity that two Englishmen have often lacked over the years. Then there is Paul Pogba. Lazy, ill-disciplined, United-can’t-rely-on-him Paul Pogba who, despite a few shaky moments, produced the type of strong, influential and disciplined performance United fans have seen for the past couple of months. And then of course there is Bruno Fernandes. Upon hearing that he would be dropped for the game today, the Portugese decided to put in an extra shift of free-kick practice on Saturday evening only to go on and unleash one during the final quarter of the game and take United to the next round. Add to this the attitude of the likes of Edinson Cavani and slowly, but surely, this United team is starting to look like one that is fit to compete.

      <h10><b>5. Respect Man, Respect</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When exactly are we going to ditch the narrative that Solskjaer is a middling, uninspiring, unimaginative coach? Yes, he has had some truly bad moments in this tenure at the club, but managing one of the biggest clubs in the world isn’t something anybody is ready for beforehand, a great deal of learning happens on the job (for more see Jurgen Klopp or a certain Mr. Sir Alex Ferguson). Ole Gunnar has now masterminded multiple victories over the likes of Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti, Jose Mourinho, Thomas Tuchel, Marcelo Bielsa and now even Jurgen Klopp. Add to that the exciting brand of football his Man United team plays and the masterful way in which he has handled the likes of Mino Raiola and Paul Pogba and you can see why there are many amongst the Red Devils’ fan base who believe that he could lead this team very, very far. There is still a long way to go and Solskjaer definitely has a lot to prove before he can be considered a true managerial great (Getting past a semi-finals might be a good starting point), but after repeated media onslaughts, the least the man deserves is a bit of respect.
