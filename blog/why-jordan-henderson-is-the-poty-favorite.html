      The PFA Player of the Year award can be a tricky thing to predict. Sometimes it will go to the best player from the best team (N’Golo Kanté in ‘17, Riyad Mahrez in ‘16), sometimes it goes to a player having an record breaking season (Mohamed Salah in ‘18, Luis Suárez in ‘14), and sometimes it just goes to the player who has the biggest impact on their team (van Dijk in ‘19). This season, there are a number of players who could fit into the first category - Alexander-Arnold, Salah, Mane, and van Dijk all have an argument for that billing - so this doesn’t seem like a year where that will decide the player of the year. Likewise, there are a number of players across the league that could all claim to have the biggest impact on their respective team. Instead, this seems like a season where an outstanding individual will win the award, and an historic Kevin De Bruyne season is looking to fit that billing. So why is Jordan Henderson a favorite for the award when he doesn’t seem to fit any of these categories? Let’s look at the data and see if we can figure it out.    </h13>

            Central midfielders don’t typically win the player of the year award. Only three have won since the turn of the century, and in a sport where goals and assists are the typically what determines these “best player” awards (see Messi and Ronaldo’s Ballon D’or duopoly) it makes it difficult for non-attacking midfielders to win. That’s not to say it’s impossible - N’Golo Kanté won in 2017 by being the best defensive midfielder in the world - but it is harder for these types of players to win these awards.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            It’s even more difficult when another player in the league is having an historic season and is on pace to break the single season assist record. Kevin De Bruyne - back from an injury that kept him out most of the 2018-19 season - might be having one of the best individual campaigns of any player in the last decade. As the below radar shows, he is in the 99th percentile of the Premier League in many key categories for his role, including expected assists per 90, key passes per 90, and shot creating actions per 90 among others.

      Jordan Henderson, on the other hand, has been great, but not the best in a few metrics including progressive passes per 90 and possession-adjusted tackles per 90. He’s been a solid piece of Liverpool’s midfield this season and important to their title charge, but has he really been outstanding enough in enough metrics to warrant discussion for being the player of the season? I would argue no.

    <h13>
      It is tough to compare players in two different roles, so I understand if some people are averse to using data to compare Henderson and De Bruyne given that the most important metrics for their roles don’t overlap much. But, I think seeing how each player performs in their most important metrics for their respective roles relative to the rest of the league can give us an idea of who is more deserving of player of the year.

<!-- 5th Paragraph -------------------------------------------------->

          <h13>
            In this case, I think it’s fairly obvious that Kevin De Bruyne has performed at a much higher level than Jordan Henderson this season. Even in the categories that do overlap, De Bruyne has performed better than Henderson in almost all of them. His xGBuildup/90 is 0.65 to Henderson’s 0.44, his Progressive Passes/90 is 11.60 to Henderson’s 7.10, and his Shot Creating Actions/90 is an absurd 6.83 to Henderson’s 1.86. Henderson isn’t required to be nearly as much of a creative threat in his role, so some of these metrics aren’t as important to him. But even in the more important metrics to a defensive-minded midfielder, Henderson only finds himself in the 90+ percentile in three categories. De Bruyne, on the other hand, shows up in seven including five in the 99th percentile.

    <h13>
      So if De Bruyne appears to be better statistically than Henderson, then why is Henderson the favorite for the player of the year award instead? The answer, unfortunately for all us stat geeks, is that this award just isn’t given based on who the best player is statistically. It’s all based around narratives, which are probably going through the minds of the players when they vote. The narrative this season is that this Liverpool team are one of, if not the, greatest teams ever. Couple this with the fact that Liverpool haven’t won the league in 30 years, and it makes sense why players might want to award a player from their squad. They don’t have any truly outstanding individual performers, so instead they want to just give the award to the captain of the squad.

<!-- 7th Paragraph -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      If Henderson wins the player of the year award, it will hardly be the strangest thing to happen in the Premier League this season. But perhaps years down the line it would be looked back on as one of the strangest decisions in the history of the award. And if Kevin De Bruyne does move on from Manchester City this summer with the Champions League ban looming, it would be a shame for him to leave without winning the award he deserves.
