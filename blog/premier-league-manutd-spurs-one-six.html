      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 1 - 1 Tottenham Hotspurs</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Let’s not beat around the bush shall we. No hyping up of the game, no dramatic introduction, no theatrics. Tottenham Hotspurs have just beaten Manchester United 6 - 1 at Old Trafford and Jose Mourinho, two years on from one of his most iconic press conferences, has garnered everyone’s respect (for the time being, but more on that later). Where did it all go wrong? Was it a Spurs masterclass, or a Manchester United disaster-class? Has Jose simply schooled Ole, or is there more than what meets the eye?

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was a complete performance from every Spurs player, from the first minute until the last (except for the penalty they conceded). Ndombele returned to the starting XI and impressed, Aurier displaced new signing Doherty and had the freedom of the right flank and Lamela improved upon an impressive midweek performance. Sidenote: I genuinely do not know how, but the Special One has convinced all of us that Erik Lamela is a good player. He really is the best. Getting back to the point, however, it is impossible to take the limelight away for Spurs’ two frontmen, Son and Kane. The duo have been in scintillating form, and combined again to score two on the day, as well as assist each other once. The second goal was a sight to witness. The quick free kick, the pace of the North Korean, and the deft touch to scoop it over De Gea. Poetry in motion. Both could have become the first players to score hat-tricks at Old Trafford against United in the Premier League since New Year’s Day 1992. Nevertheless, they will not forget this victory anytime soon.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Let’s dial it back a little bit shall we. All this Spurs optimism is a little too much for me. Everyone in the football world has learned more about Jose Mourinho and the North London club than ever before. Optimism is at an all time high. Mourinho has convinced fans and the board of his project, and the club are backing him handsomely. So many tid-bits from the documentary are materialsing in real life, and yes, we don’t know how authentic it might have been, but the evidence is undeniable. Serge Aurier is making his way into the opposition 18 yard box periodically, his goal capping of a great performance and Spurs look like a team ready for the fight, not the nice guys Jose found when he arrived. Spurs were not scared to play tough and were constantly biting at United, perfectly using tactical fouls whenever required. But, and yes, there was always going to be a but, if history means anything, with Jose Mourinho there is always a trade off. Short term success, followed by turmoil and an eventual toxic environment at the club. For a team like Spurs, hiring Mourinho was almost like giving their golden era one last shot with a historic manager, and then accepting that the next manager would be given a hot mess and a long term project. A week ago Jose was the man who had marginalised Alli, burned out a promising talent in Ndombele and was struggling to keep players fit for four games within a week. Yes, his team looked the fresher on the day and yes, things look on the up right now, but it is amazing how reactionary the football community is. This is Jose Mourinho, things are bound to go wrong. If not… we really are seeing a completely new Jose. 2020, you might just have done it again.

      <h10><b>3. Let’s Talk About VAR…</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In all honesty, it’s not something I enjoy talking about as well, but I think it has to be spoken about. Let’s forget how embarrassing it was for Lamela to just go down like a three year old in a playground (Yes, I’m salty, deal with it). How have VAR not gone in Anthony Taylor ears and said, “Hey buddy, you might want to check the pitchside monitor. Lamela has hit Martial and then he’s returned the favour. I’d do the sensible thing and give them both the same punishment.” Clearly that conversation did not take place. There’s way too many problems with this decision. Was it a red card in the first place? Why wasn’t the entire incident reviewed? Turns out, it was, because Lamela still got a yellow card. How the referees and VAR have actually seen this and decided that both players do not deserve the same punishment is absolutely beyond me. Man United would still have lost, so this is not an excuse, but VAR has had a proper nightmare here.

      <h10><b>4. A Coach’s Game?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Usually in football, and rightly so, for the pain they put themselves through, the players are the superstars of the game. They receive the plaudits, and sometimes find themselves in a situation where they are never held accountable, while the manager is criticised endlessly. Being a manager or a coach can feel like a thankless job. If the last two days have told us anything though, it is that football is not as simple as fans might think. Hours go into tactical analysis and learning how to play in a system, how to accept a philosophy and how to master your position. Bielsa, Guardiola, Mourinho - all men that understand the game better than anyone else on the planet and that is materialising on the pitch. Yes, man managers are important, especially art big clubs, but you can’t be all about that. In a world where big name signings are all the talk, being able to improve players at the club is an invaluable trait… and that’s one more reason why Sir Alex is the greatest there’s ever been (Yes, I’m going to shoehorn him in here, and there’s nothing you can do about it).

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Honestly, all United need to do is regroup. Go back to the drawing board. Take a step back and assess the situation. Yes, the loss is embarrassing and yes, the reaction should be severe, but let’s put things into context. City are coming off a 5-2 loss at home. Liverpool have just lost 7-2 to Aston Villa. Things might feel bleak for United fans right now, but it really can’t get any worse than this. The International Break will definitely be a welcome distraction, as the club tries to get back on its feet. In the long run though, the same problems persist and more worryingly, grow. Money is still being taken out of the club and its reputation takes hit after hit. Whatever happens, even if Matt Judge and Ed Woodward resign tomorrow morning and the club is sold, it will pay the price for years to come. The holes are too deep at Manchester United and right now, nobody seems like they can dig them out of it. But this is not the first time, is it? Coming back from a point where everyone has given up on them is what Manchester United means. One day it will happen, but that day might feel like an eternity away right now.
