      <h12><b>Final Score: FC Barcelona 1 - 3 Real Madrid CF</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Coming off of two brutal losses to Cádiz and Shakhtar Donetsk this week, Real Madrid looked to forget their poor performances and have a strong game against a Barcelona side that hadn’t been as menacing in recent seasons. The game couldn’t have started more perfectly for Real Madrid as Federico Valverde opened the scoresheet just five minutes into the game. Benzema found himself dribbling into poorly positioned Lenglet and Pique, and he was able to weigh a perfect pass through to the young Uruguayan who made no mistake finding the top left of Barcelona’s goal. Barcelona was able to equalize quickly as Messi played a perfect ball down the left to an open Jordi Alba who sent it to Ansu Fati in the box, and he only needed a slight touch with the outside of his boot to beat Courtois. Each side had spurts of momentum, and Barcelona looked particularly strong until about the 60th minute where Sergio Ramos earned a penalty after Lenglet tugged his shirt in the box. Ramos was able to convert this penalty, giving Real Madrid the lead, and it was lights out from there on. Barcelona looked sluggish and uninspired to equalize for the second time as Modric put the dagger in them in the 90th minute.

      <h10><b>1. Sergiño Dest Was on Point</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Despite the rather poor defensive performance by the Barcelona back line, particularly in the final ⅓ of the match, Ronald Koeman’s decision to play the inexperienced Sergiño Dest proved to be a good one. After starting at left-back, an unnatural position for Dest, last weekend against Getafe, it is clear that Dest made a bigger impact in his natural right-back spot as Jordi Alba returned to the lineup. Many had their doubts about the young American defender’s future at Barcelona as he didn’t get much playing time at his former club, Ajax, but in a true test in his club’s greatest rivalry match Dest excelled defensively. He made strong, momentum-breaking tackles on Vinicius Junior and Karim Benzema, and even though Barcelona came away with zero points it was evident that Dest wasn’t the problem on defense as he had nullified Madrid’s most lethal attackers. Dest also looked very poised on the ball as he had no trouble playing through the high press of Real Madrid. Barcelona fans as well as United States fans should be very optimistic about this youngster going forward.

      <h10><b>2. Messi, Fati, and Coutinho Not in Their Natural Positions</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Ronald Koeman’s influence on the Barcelona lineup has been very apparent in just his first few matches as manager for the club, and this can be seen through his asking of some players to drift away from their natural positions. For instance, Ansu Fati sacrificed his typical role as the left winger to play a striker’s role in El Clasico, and Coutinho filled in for the youngster away from his natural CAM spot. It was also interesting to see Lionel Messi drop back as far as the Barcelona defensive line during the match as he received the ball at the center circle several times to deposit it down the line. This is what led Barcelona’s 8th minute equalizer where Messi received the ball near the half line and sent a beautiful ball over the top to his reliable workhorse left-back, Jordi Alba. Alba sends a low cross into a streaking Fati who tucks the ball into the bottom right for the easy finish and 1-1 scoreline. It’s also important to note that the youngster Pedri, who had put in a great shift as the CAM last weekend vs Getafe, started as a right-midfielder against Los Blancos. He had a relatively quiet game as Barcelona clearly favored that connection between Alba, Coutinho, and Fati on the left side of the field. Overall, it is exciting to see Koeman attempt to experiment with unorthodox changes in his squad’s playing style, but he must work to ensure that his players are comfortable in the roles that he gives them. I don’t anticipate Pedri will continue to start at right-midfield after today’s performance, and Koeman will definitely have to find a way to get Coutinho and Fati going if he wants to continue employing these new roles for them.

      <h10><b>3. Real Madrid’s Defense Remains on Top</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      After a midweek defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League which saw Los Blancos concede three goals to the Ukrainians, Real Madrid fans wondered how their back line would fare against the powerhouse attack of their rivals Barcelona. In El Clasico, Madrid’s defense put in a brilliant performance, silencing both Lionel Messi and Phillipe Coutinho. While they did concede an 8th minute goal to wonderkid Ansu Fati, the rest of the match proved to be a solid performance from the men in white. There were a few incidents, however, that forced Real Madrid defenders (especially Sergio Ramos and Casemiro) to make risky, last-ditch tackles to keep Barcelona’s attackers from finding the back of the net. Coming off of a horrible performance against Shakhtar, center back Rafa Varane put in a quality shift against the Blaugrana (which only gives more gravity to the theory that he needs Sergio Ramos to perform at his highest level). The Frenchman was both good in possession, and covered well for third and fourth-choice right backs Nacho and Lucas Vazquez. In the other center back role, Sergio Ramos was his usual immense self. All of his tackles were perfectly timed, and aside from being turned inside-out by Lionel Messi twice, it was a top performance from the record El Clasico appearance holder. Ramos also won and scored the game winning penalty, taking his tally to 2 goals for this La Liga campaign.

      <h10><b>4. Fede Valverde Was All Over the Field</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      It was interesting to see Zidane start Valverde over Modric in this match, as he usually favors experience in his team’s biggest games. However, Valverde’s ability to press players all over the pitch for 90 minutes was an asset Zidane wanted in the squad against Barcelona, and his gamble paid off. The Uruguayan was key to Real Madrid’s defense on their right side, and he did quite well in his attempts to  stifle Frenkie de Jong. He tracked back well to give Nacho support in defending both Phillipe Coutinho and Jordi Alba, something that Modric could not offer at 35 years old. Fede’s incredible work rate in attack was huge for Madrid against Barcelona as well, and it was his goal that initially put Los Blancos in front in the 5th minute of the match. He made an excellent run out of the midfield to split Barcelona’s center backs, and a Karim Benzema through-ball gave him the space to put an excellently-placed shot into the back of Neto’s net. Valverde’s match came to an end in the 69th minute, as he was substituted due to an injury. Hopefully the Uruguayan will face a quick recovery, as he has become one of the most important players in this Madrid side.

      <h10><b>5. Madrid’s Second Goal Killed Barcelona Momentum</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      The match completely changed for both sides after Sergio Ramos’ 63rd minute penalty. Barcelona went into all-out attack mode, and began to throw numbers forward in search of an equalizer. They began to hold more possession of the ball as Madrid packed numbers into their own box in hopes that they could defend their lead. Eventually, Koeman became desperate enough to bring on Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele, Francisco Trincao, and Martin Braithwaite, rolling out a lineup that looked more like a 3-1-4-2. Despite their efforts, Barcelona wouldn’t find an equalizer, as Madrid’s defense stood like an impenetrable wall. As Barcelona were bringing so many players into their attack, this left their defense vulnerable for Madrid to counter attack. Earlier on, Real Madrid tended to clear the ball after winning it in their penalty area, but they eventually became more confident with their counters as the match wore on. Finally, in the 90th minute, Luka Modric capitalized on Barcelona’s poor defensive positioning, and he grabbed a third goal for Madrid, humiliating Neto and Barcelona’s defense with his skills and a shot with the outside of his boot.
