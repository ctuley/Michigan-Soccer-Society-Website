      <h12><b>Final Score: Leicester City 2-0 Chelsea</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There was plenty on the line for both teams heading into Tuesday’s match. Leicester had a chance to go top of the table with a win, while Chelsea tried to remedy a rough patch of form with a second straight win. In a game light on chances, Leicester took advantage of theirs and emerged victorious 2-0. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. The Best Available Player Is Not Always The Best Signing</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While they did not exactly look like title contenders, Chelsea looked like they were moving in the right direction. It was a transition year with a first-year head coach and a roster in-between cores of players, yet they were able to slip into a Champions League spot. This may have been the worst thing for the club, as there were now much higher expectations heading into 2020-21. Still, with a great young core starting to establish themselves and even more talent coming through the academy, Chelsea were in a good spot to improve on the good results from the previous season. A couple more pieces (particularly a goalkeeper and a left-back) combined with some patience and this team could be challenging for titles in a couple of seasons.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        However, with a transfer ban no longer in place, Chelsea decided to splurge and spent $270 million on new players - trying to fill all the gaps in the team at once. Some of these signings made sense: Edouard Mendy, while not a great goalkeeper by any means, was an upgrade on Kepa, and Ben Chilwell, despite the hefty fee, was a good left-back that fit what Lampard was trying to do. But Chelsea did not stop there. They decided to spend over 200 of their $270 million on players in positions they did not need. Research has shown that it is much more beneficial to sign a player in your weakest position than to upgrade one of your stronger ones, and when healthy Abraham, Pulisic, and Hudson-Odoi’s performances showed these were positions that did not need strengthening. Depth was needed, but depth signings can be made without disrupting the core of a growing team.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Clearly, the constant changing of the offensive front has had an effect on the team as, despite their high goal/expected goal metrics, there is no flow or cohesion to this attack. This, ultimately, has caused them to have games recently where the offense leaves much to be desired.

      <h10><b>2. Chelsea Midfield Issues Cause Trouble Throughout Team</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The wealth of attacking talent and lack of midfield depth signings has also created problems further back in this Chelsea team. Lampard’s midfield selections have been strange all season. Sometimes he will run a more attacking-minded midfielder in a spot that sees congestion in the half-space due to the winger on that side moving in (like Pulisic and Mount whenever they play). Sometimes, like today, he will run a midfield with almost no balance. With N’Golo Kante out, Lampard selected Mateo Kovacic to play as the lone pivot - a role he is not used to playing in and does not fit either in possession or out of it. In the two other midfield slots, Lampard picked Mason Mount and Kai Havertz - two talented players, but two very attack-oriented midfielders leaving a defensively unsound Kovacic to cover the midfield himself. This is not necessarily bad - Manchester City play a similar way - but combined with Lampard picking very attacking fullbacks, it left a not-very-mobile Thiago Silva exposed while also creating too much congestion in the attacking phase. Leicester took advantage by sitting deep, causing even more congestion, and attacking Thiago Silva on the counter. It worked out for the Foxes and Chelsea saw themselves leave with no points.

      <h10><b>3. Leicester Control The Game Despite Lack Of Possession</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As I mentioned before, Chelsea played right into Leicester’s hands. The Foxes are perfectly happy to sit deep and draw you out before striking quick on the other end. When they are on their A-game finishing-wise, they are a very tough team to beat when they play this way. Today they were, and though they did not create a ton of chances, they created three really good ones and scored on one of them (an extra low-probability goal from Wilfred Ndidi helped out too). They smothered Chelsea on the defensive end, and while Chelsea looked like getting back in the game before VAR overturned a penalty call, Leicester immediately scored on the next possession and the win was never in doubt.

      <h10><b>4. Leicester A Real Top Four Threat</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I recently got into an argument with my friends over whether or not this Leicester team is better than the team that won the title in 2016. While they might not match the achievements, I think on paper this team is much better than the Champions. While they will not get the same luck with injuries and other teams falling apart, this Leicester team is dangerous. They can beat you in many different ways - by dominating you with possession or beating you on the counter - and their depth is strong. Despite losing Ben Chilwell to a transfer, and losing Ricardo Periera and Caglar Soyuncu to injury, the defense remains a strength of this team as James Justin and Wesley Fofana have both filled in nicely. The offense is starting to come together as well. Jamie Vardy is playing as well as ever, Harvey Barnes is continuing his good form from last season, and James Maddison is back from injury and running the show. This Leicester team is a serious threat for a Champions League place, and who knows, maybe they will hit a bit of luck and challenge for the title too.

      <h10><b>5. Pulisic’s Struggles Continue</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After his ridiculously good end of last season, Christian Pulisic faced some big expectations from Chelsea fans and rival fans looking to call him overrated. While he has had his moments and has been one of Chelsea’s best play drivers this season through his ball-carrying ability, his end product has just not been where it needs to be so far. Now, he has dealt with injury issues so far, and team selection in other places has hindered his (and his teammates) performances a bit as I mentioned above, but the dropoff in form is stark and he just cannot seem to shake off the rust. Perhaps he just needs some time on the bench to be set straight, but Pulisic has always been the guy who wants to work himself out of a bad stretch. The narratives are not being kind to him right now, but one or two goals should relax him, raise his confidence, and see him return to normal. As a US National Team fan, I just hope he figures it out in time for qualifying in September.
