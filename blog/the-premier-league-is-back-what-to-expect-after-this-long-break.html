    <h10>The Premier League is Back! What to Expect After this Long Break</h10>

    <h13>After more than three months of waiting, we are less than a week away from
      the return of the Premier League. However, playing football during a global
      pandemic comes with some challenges, most evident in the lack of fans present.
      Before the first kick off, let’s examine some of the new norms we can expect, and
      how these will affect the rest of the season.
    </h13>

    <h13>
      As seen in the return of the Bundesliga so far, the atmosphere is completely
      different on the pitch, causing matches to be less momentum based. Due to these
      changes in atmosphere, I expect that the talent gap will be accentuated, leading to
      fewer upsets from the lower standing clubs. Having to play away from home is
      hardly a disadvantage without fans shifting the tides of the game. In fact, according
      to an article from ESPN’s Tom Hamilton, home win percentages in the Bundesliga
      have dropped from 43.3% to 21.7% since the return. These empty stadiums are
      proving to level the playing field, and I expect the majority of outcomes to be in
      favor of the better side. The top three teams of Liverpool, Manchester City, and
      Leicester City should find themselves winning out most of their games against the
      clubs in the bottom half of the table. Upsets are bound to happen as these times are
      currently more unpredictable than ever, but the lack of a home field advantage will
      most likely favor the more talented side.
    </h13>

    <h13>
      With that being said, it can be almost guaranteed that Liverpool will win their
      first Premier League title this year. With a 25 point lead and coming off a 6-0
      battering of Blackburn in a club friendly this week, it seems that they are ready to
      finish the job this year. It will be a tad bittersweet having no fans to celebrate in front
      of, but after 30 years of waiting, I’m sure Klopp and his boys will be overjoyed to lift
      that trophy. In addition to winning the league, Liverpool have the opportunity to
      break many records, such as Manchester United’s record of fewest games
      remaining when clinching the title (5 games) or Manchester City’s record of 100
      points in a season. Having been knocked out of the Champions League before the
      hiatus, Liverpool will have their full focus set on winning the league, and it will be fun
      to watch this squad finish their season.

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Another rule change that will affect the return of the season comes in the
      form of substitution reform. For the remainder of the season, teams will be allowed
      benches of nine players and up to five substitutions as opposed to the usual three
      per game. These new substitution rules will allow for teams to completely change
      their shape and play styles mid game and will really benefit teams who have deep
      and talented benches. Clubs like Chelsea and Manchester City should benefit highly
      from these additional substitutions with their depth and young talent. Chelsea’s Billy
      Gilmour, Christian Pulisic, and Callum Hudson-Odoi will likely see the pitch more
      frequently, possibly allowing them to prove their talent and earn a transfer or a
      more permanent spot in the lineup. In addition to the young talent on show, it will be
      interesting to see how well recent transfers such as Manchester United’s Bruno
      Fernandes and Tottenham’s Steven Bergwijn fit into their squads, after hot starts in
      their first five appearances.

<!-- 5th Paragraph -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The last expectation I have for the return of the season is a top seven battle
      for the ages. With Manchester City’s Champions League ban in place and Liverpool’s
      spot secured, the rest of the teams will be left to battle it out for their chance at
      European football next season. Only 13 points separate third place Leicester from
      ninth place Arsenal, and with seven matches to go and some high tier matchups, the
      fight is on for these clubs. Newly promoted Sheffield United looks poised for a
      Europa League ticket if they can hang on. Additionally, Arsenal and Tottenham are
      currently on the outside looking in, just three and two points away respectively from
      their chance at returning to European football. With less than 10 matches remaining
      for the London clubs, it is crunch time.

    <h13>
      In these uncertain times, having football back in action is something that we
      can all look forward to and celebrate together. Kicking off Wednesday June 17th
      with two matches and continuing on a near daily basis after, there is plenty to keep
      you occupied for the remainder of the summer. Whether your club is fighting
      relegation, earning their spot to play in Europe next season, or even if you have no
      stakes in the league other than loving the game, there is action for everyone to
      enjoy with its return.
