      <h12><b>Final Score: Chelsea 1-1 Aston Villa</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Aston Villa secured a point on the road against Chelsea on Monday night. Olivier Giroud’s impressive header in the first half was canceled out by an equally skillful finish by Anwar El Ghazi early in the second period. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Villa Do Just Enough</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although Aston Villa were on the ropes for much of the second half, they managed to defend well and even dominate certain periods of the game. Jack Grealish led the charge in the opening minutes and forced Édouard Mendy into making a tough save on an effort from the edge of the box. Olivier Giroud’s opener could have easily been a death sentence for Dean Smith’s side, but the players responded brilliantly and managed to score early in the second half to tie the contest at one. Despite Chelsea throwing themselves at the Villa backline in the last 20 minutes to break the deadlock, Villa held strong and even started multiple counter-attacks, notably almost scoring through great efforts from John McGinn and James Ramsey. It wasn’t a flashy performance from the usually entertaining side, but going into Stamford Bridge and leaving with a point is always a good outcome.

      <h10><b>2. Chelsea Attack Better, But Far From Perfect</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Blues have been heavily criticized during their recent tough stretch, mostly due to their lack of success on the attacking end of the pitch. Against Arsenal, Chelsea’s full-backs continually pinged crosses to players standing aimlessly in the box, which led to a shocking defeat at the Emirates. Frank Lampard finally decided to start two true wingers in the form of Christain Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi, and the decision certainly made his side’s attack much more dynamic. Pulisic and Hudson-Odoi were able to cut inside to create chances for themselves and their teammates, while Ben Chilwell and César Azpilicueta were still able to make overlapping runs to supply crosses. The introduction of Hudson-Odoi is a welcome sight for Chelsea fans who have had to watch Timo Werner suffer on the wing in recent weeks, a position he is not built to play. Although Chelsea could only muster one goal from their efforts, Monday night was a step in the right direction for a side that has struggled to create in recent weeks. Hakim Ziyech’s return in the coming weeks should make the Blues much more threatening and creative in the final third.

      <h10><b>3. Dean Smith Continues to Impress</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Dean Smith has done an amazing job at Aston Villa since joining the club in October of 2018. The club was in the middle of the Championship table at the time of his takeover but fought hard to make the playoff and eventually get promoted to the Premier League that same season. Although Villa found themselves in a relegation battle last season, they currently sit six points off the top of the table with a game in hand on league leaders Liverpool. Smith’s brilliance was on full display Monday night at Stamford Bridge as his team came from behind against a big opponent to force a draw, and one even can argue that Villa could have gone on to take all three points from Chelsea. No, Aston Villa will not win this year’s Premier League, but they will not have to worry for a second about being relegated to the Championship like they did last year. If all things go as planned (and if the 2020-2021 season continues to be one of the weirdest on record), Dean Smith could find himself managing a team in a European cup competition next season. By all accounts, he deserves the opportunity.

      <h10><b>4. Chelsea Stuck in the Blues</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        A month ago, Chelsea fans thought their team would go on to compete for the Premier League title. Now, that dream appears to be dead as Chelsea have managed just four points from their last five matches and have fallen out of a top-four position. Much is going wrong at the club right now: a manager who seems tactically inept, expensive signings struggling to adapt, and injuries to key players. However, what is most concerning to fans and management has to be the overall lack of fight from the players in the squad every week. Chelsea is usually a side that responds to losses with statement victories led by standout performances from star players, but this team does not have someone to turn to during this tumultuous stretch. The days of heroics from Eden Hazard, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, and others may be gone, but someone has to lead this team out of the rut. Can Christian Pulisic step up and return to his Project Restart form? Does Mason Mount know how to score a goal? Will Timo Werner and Kai Havertz finally settle into English football and dominate the Premier League? Time will tell, but Monday night’s result is further proof that this Chelsea team needs a spark and it needs it now.

      <h10><b>5. Time Running Out on Lampard</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The clock is ticking on the Chelsea legend as his time as manager may soon come to an end. Securing a spot in the Champions League and reaching the FA Cup Final with such a young squad were tremendous accomplishments last season, but a manager cannot be allowed to spend $292 million and finish outside of the top four. Chelsea actually have fewer points than they did at this point last season which is simply unacceptable given the size of the club and Frank Lampard’s spending spree. Lampard continues to make questionable team selections and is still struggling to pick an ideal formation and style of play for this squad. It was wishful thinking to believe Chelsea would win the Premier League this season given the strength of sides like Liverpool and Manchester City, but finishing outside the top four would be a complete embarrassment for the club. If Chelsea fail to qualify for next year’s Champions League and have a quick exit from the FA Cup, Lampard will surely lose his job despite having one year left on his contract. The next few months will show fans just how “super” Frank really is.
