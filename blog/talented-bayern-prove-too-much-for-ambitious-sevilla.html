      <h12><b>Final Score: FC Bayern Munich 2-1 Sevilla FC</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Julen Lopetegui’s efforts as manager for Sevilla do not go unnoticed in a loss that was much closer than expected. Sevilla earned a penalty early thanks to returning midfielder Ivan Rakitic, and Lucas Ocampos tucked it into the bottom left corner for the 1-0 lead after 13 minutes. Bayern seemed desperate for an equalizer for the next 20 minutes after that, and after penetrating an aggressive Sevilla high press they were able to successfully counter attack and earn that equalizer 33 minutes in thanks to Leon Goretzka’s half-volley into the bottom left. The rest of the match proved to be a defensive one due to Lopetegui’s conservative tactics and substitutions as the second-half was a scoreless one. The match headed to extra time knotted at 1-1. The next goal would not come until the 103rd minute where substitute Javi Martinez pounces with a header into the bottom left. The chance came from Sevilla keeper Yassine Bounou who desperately parried the ball right to Martinez off an Alaba volley. FC Bayern won 2-1 and earned their fourth trophy of the season, further cementing this year’s team as one of the greatest in history. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Lopetegui’s High Press Paid off Early</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite the loss, Julen Lopetegui cannot get enough credit for the effort he put out with his squad in this match. The Sevilla manager is fully aware of the strengths and weaknesses of not only his squad but his opponent’s squad as well, and he took advantage of that from the moment the match kicked off. Contrary to Barcelona’s dreadful 2-8 performance against Bayern in August, where Barcelona attempted to play through their defensive third, Lopetegui took a gamble with his squad and pressed Bayern into their own half instead. He implemented a high press through newly resigned midfielder Ivan Rakitic, pushing him about as high as a center forward and pressuring the defense when they had the ball. Bayern played particularly jittery for the first 15 minutes, and that really cost them when Rakitic won Sevilla a penalty early on. Lopetegui’s high press clearly paid off and Sevilla took their ever desired 1-0 lead over the treble winning side.

      <h10><b>2. Bayern’s Success Comes Through the Middle</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Don’t let the intimidating pace of Bayern’s wingers, Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sané, fool you. This team plays their best football when they run their attacks through the middle. Lopetegui was very aware of this, and this was a major reason why he implemented the high press. Rakitic man-marked Joshua Kimmich for the first third of the match, and that essentially forced Bayern to play down the wings. With speedster Alphonso Davies on the bench for Bayern, it was clear that they were not comfortable doing so as they generated little offense early in the match. Bayern did not score until they broke through Sevilla’s high press, which is exactly what happened in the buildup to their 33rd minute equalizer. Kimmich found himself dribbling at full speed through an empty center circle as he deposited the ball at the feet of the highly talented attack. Eventually, Thomas Müller chipped a ball into the box toward Robert Lewandowski who tapped it back to Leon Goretzka for the easy finish.

      <h10><b>3. Sevilla’s Defense Kept Them in the Match</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After taking the early lead, Sevilla made it clear that they were going to attempt to play defensively for most of the game. Lopetegui’s high press through Ivan Rakitic was effective, but he knew that it was not sustainable for a full 90 minutes, so he subbed in Oliver Torres for Rakitic at the 56th minute. Lopetegui also subbed in Nemanja Gudelj, a defender, for Suso, an attacker, in the 73rd minute. Sevilla also appeared to rotate between a 4-5-1 and a 5-4-1 defensive shape in the 2nd half. Bayern manager Hans-Dieter Flick took note of this tactical switch, urging his squad to revert to their infamous “high line” for the final 15 minutes of the match. Despite this, Sevilla was a wall. In fact, the high line almost cost Bayern the game as Sevilla actually broke for a dangerous counter attack in the 87th minute. However, Manuel Neuer reminded everyone of his legendary status with the crucial 1v1 save on Youssef En-Nesyri. Through a defense led by the disciplined Diego Carlos, it is impressive that Sevilla was able to hold a powerhouse like Bayern Munich to just 1 goal through regulation.

      <h10><b>4. Alphonso Davies’ Absence was Almost Costly for Bayern</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a match where Bayern had the chance to earn their fourth trophy of the year, it boggles my mind that Hans-Dieter Flick chose to leave fully fit world-class left-back Alphonso Davies on the bench until extra time. It proved costly in regulation as the team struggled to attack down the left with Lucas Hernandez, a more defensive player. Bayern could’ve really used a speedy dribbler that could bring the ball across half like Davies when they were pressed into their half early on. He could’ve made the difference in defense and attack, but Bayern came away with the victory anyway. The match would not have been as close as it was if Davies started, and his importance was apparent the minute he entered the field early in extra time. Bayern’s attack was much more fluid and quick as he dribbled past defenders with his fresh legs. Ultimately, this resurgence of offense did result in a string of corner kicks for Bayern, which eventually led to their second goal and the victory. The only explanation for Davies’ absence for most of the game is that he wasn’t fully fit. But who knows?

      <h10><b>5. Bayern is Too Talented for Sevilla</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In the end, despite an optimal performance from Sevilla with respect to their squad, Bayern took the victory because they simply have more talented players than Sevilla does. This was evident in the teamplay leading to Bayern’s first goal. Sevilla’s greatest mistake in leading to Bayern’s equalizer was not made in the defensive third. It was made when they allowed Bayern to attack through the middle of the field. Once the raumdeuter himself Thomas Müller chipped the ball up to Lewandowski there was not much the defense could do but hope that Bayern’s offense did not produce a moment of magic like they usually did. To their dismay, Bayern did produce that magic and scored. A sub-par managing performance by Hans-Dieter Flick was rescued by his creative and reliable players, because in the end football is a game between the players on the field. The managers have an impact on how they play, but ultimately it is what the players do that determines the outcome of the match. Lopetegui’s remarkable efforts earned his side a close battle in extra time, but Bayern’s championship squad consisting of players like Lewandowski, Muller, Alaba, and, at the end, Davies proved to be too much for a Sevilla squad that made its name in the Europa League.
