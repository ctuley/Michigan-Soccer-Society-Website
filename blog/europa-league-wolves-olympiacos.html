      <h12><b>Final Score: Wolves 1-0 Olympiacos (2-1 aggregate)</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The never-ending season continues on for Wolves as they finish off Greek champions Olympiacos at home. It was a tight match, with Wolves comfortable defending their advantage after going up 2-1 on aggregate in the 8th minute. A late surge wasn’t enough for Olympiacos to find a goal, but they’ll be happy to start preparing for a Champions League campaign next season. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. No Adjustments Needed For Wolves To Get The Job Done</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Wolves had the slight advantage coming into this second leg - leading on away goals - and after some early pressing that led to their first goal through a penalty, the English club comfortably set up shop in their typical tight mid-block happy to see out the game. Though chances occasionally came from quick counterattacks - as they usually do from Wolves - in possession, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side favored a conservative approach, patiently passing back-and-forth horizontally until an opening appeared. They couldn’t turn it into a second goal, but fortunately, they didn’t need to. Wolves rode their typical gameplan to victory Thursday, but it will be interesting to see if Nuno makes any changes for the quarterfinal against a much more difficult opponent in Sevilla.

      <h10><b>2. Olympiacos Lacked The Necessary Incisiveness</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I’ll be honest, I hadn’t watched Olympiacos this season before Thursday. It’s a bit difficult to find Greek soccer here in the States. Nevertheless, I had an idea of what I thought Olympiacos would play like coming into this one. Given they are the top team in their league, I figured they’d likely play a possession heavy system that made use of wide areas via attacking fullbacks with a defensive midfielder dropping deep and recycling possession. I was actually spot on here, though I wasn’t exactly sure how good they would be at executing their gameplan. The Greek club struggled to create chances for much of the match, and when they did they often weren’t great ones - settling for long shots or mishitting the ones from good positions. Wolves forced Olympiacos wide a lot, and they struggled to break down Wolves’ compact 5-3-2 (3-4-3 when in possession). The Greek champions surged late, creating more and better chances than they had all game, but they weren’t clinical enough in front of goal to find that equalizer. Olympiacos are a good team, but they came up against a bad matchup for them that forced them to be at their best. Unfortunately for them, they were not.

              Signed from Olympiacos in January, Wolves’ Daniel Podence has not gotten many opportunities to prove himself in England so far. However, when given the call to action against his former club, the Portuguese winger did not disappoint. Rotating between the left-wing and center-forward positions, his pressing and off-ball movement cause the Olympiacos defense all sorts of troubles. In fact, his pressing forced the turnover in the penalty area that eventually led to him being fouled by the Olympiacos goalkeeper and created the only goal of the match - a cooly taken penalty by Raul Jimenez. It was an excellent performance, and Podence is definitely one to keep an eye on as we head into next season.

      <h10><b>4. Someone Needs To Fix The Field At The Molineux</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I don’t really know what happened, but someone turned the field at the Molineux into a slip-and-slide for this match. It didn’t look like it was raining, so I’m not really sure how the field got so slippery. Normally something like this wouldn’t stick out to me, especially if the field still looks in good condition - which it did. However, on multiple occasions, the slickness of the field had an impact on the game. The first happened early in the game when Wolves’ left wingback Jonny slipped when turning to receive the ball and, under no pressure, injured his leg. He was forced to exit the game and Wolves were stuck with their second-string wingback Ruben Vinagre. The second happened later in the first half when Wolves won the ball just past midfield and Raul Jimenez played a nice through-ball in behind to Adama Traore in space. We’ve all seen this movie before. Only, in an M. Night Shyamalan-level twist, Traore slipped just outside the box and the counterattack was dead. They won’t be playing on it anymore this season, but someone, please, check on that field before the new campaign starts next month.

      <h10><b>5. Wolves Will Be Missed In Europe Next Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I’ve enjoyed watching Wolves quite a bit over the last couple of months. They’re a fun team, capable of exciting counterattacks and patient possession play capped off with a brilliant line-breaking pass from Conor Coady or Ruben Neves. They’ve been a worthy challenger in both this season’s Premier League and Europa League. Sadly, after Arsenal’s FA Cup victory, they will need to win the whole tournament to play in Europe next season. It’s a shame. They’re building something exciting at Wolves, and a second straight season of European competition would have helped that immensely. All is not lost, however, and expect them to be challenging for Europe yet again next season. But for now, we’ll have to get our Adama Traore fix by following their domestic campaign.
