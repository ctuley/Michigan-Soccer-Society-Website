      <h12><b>Final Score: Dortmund 2-3 Bayern Munich</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was an early-season (potential) title decider, and an important match for both teams to come out of with three points. Dortmund and Bayern came into the match level on points at the top of the Bundesliga. Both teams had their big chances, but it was Bayern Munich who emerged victorious. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Bayern A Bit Lucky To Pick Up The Win</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Every great team needs a little bit of luck, and Bayern Munich are no different. The European champions are the more talented team - although that could be argued in this game with the injuries to their defense - but they were outplayed by Dortmund. Though shot numbers are very similar (15-14 in favor of Dortmund), the expected goals paint a better picture. According to understat.com, Dortmund’s expected goals were 2.31 to Bayern’s 1.34. Though Bayern did have a couple of big chances (shots with an xG over 0.3), they did not score either of them. Instead, Bayern’s three goals came from shots with a combined xG of 0.2. On top of that, there were deflections galore helping Bayern score their goals, even one on a last-minute goal that was eventually ruled out for offsides. Bayern were lucky today, but sometimes you need luck to win championships.

      <h10><b>2. Dortmund Dominate 2nd Half But Can’t Make It Count</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As lucky as Bayern may have been relative to their expected goals, Dortmund were very unlucky. Dortmund had four chances with an xG over 0.25, including two over 0.5. Unfortunately, they were only able to score two of these big chances. Bad finishing could have been a factor but given that the missed chances were taken by Erling Haaland and Marcos Reus, the players that scored their two goals, I’m going with bad luck as the major factor. Poor luck was the theme of Dortmund’s second half, absolutely dominating in terms of chance creation (with an xG of 1.0 to Bayern’s 0.4) but unable to come out of it with anything other than an excellently taken goal from Erling Haaland. If not for three low percentage shots turned into goals for Bayern, perhaps Dortmund would have taken three points from this game.

      <h10><b>3. Bayern’s Injury-Riddled Backline Is A Big Problem</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The personnel brought in to replace Alphonso Davies and Benjamin Pavard have not been bad so far, but they bring different skillsets that do not really suit the defensive scheme Bayern have been trying to play over the last year. The big feature of Bayern’s defensive gameplan has been their aggressively high backline. Sometimes it has not been a big issue, as their aggressive pressing usually means opponents do not even reach their defense most of the time. However, when teams can break through the press, Bayern have to rely on the recovery pace of their individual defenders to get cover the space in behind. Unfortunately, when Alphonso Davies is out of the lineup, they do not really have an adequate replacement that can bring what Davies does. As a result, Bayern are very vulnerable to quick counterattacks - one of Dortmund’s biggest strengths - and it gave them a lot of trouble against Dortmund. There really isn’t an easy solution to this problem, and Bayern will just need to hope their fullbacks recover from injury quickly.

      <h10><b>4. Gio Reyna Is Exactly What The US National Team Needs</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Sometimes one of your big takeaways from a game has nothing to do with either team involved. That is usually what happens when I watch Dortmund play with Gio Reyna on the field. I like to keep an eye on the American players with their club teams so I can gauge how they might fit together when we finally see them again with the national team. Gio Reyna seems exactly like the type of attacking midfielder the USMNT needs right now. He adds composure and tempo control that offers a nice counterpoint to the hectic attacking style of Christian Pulisic. His skillset suits patient buildup play - useful against CONCACAF teams that like to sit deep and soak up pressure - but Reyna is also adept at playing in behind on the break. We saw that a lot from him today as Dortmund’s frontline hit Bayern’s high defensive line on the break to mixed results. Reyna may not put up big goal and assist numbers, but he is a great facilitator, using his movement and calm passing to help set others up to find a breakthrough.

      <h10><b>5. Is This It For Dortmund?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both teams needed a win in this one but based on previous seasons, Dortmund really needed three points here. Any time you have the chance to take points off of the champions, you have to do it because Bayern do not drop points easily. They are so much stronger than anyone else in the league, you really cannot afford to dig yourself a hole. Dortmund have one more shot to make up the deficit later in the season, but they have pretty much lost all breathing room. They will need to be near perfect the rest of the way to keep Bayern from winning a ninth title in a row, but unfortunately for Dortmund fans, I just do not see that happening.
