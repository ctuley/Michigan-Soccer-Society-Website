        It’s been a strange Premier League season so far. Top teams have underperformed, there have been shocking heavy defeats, and after six weeks Everton finds themselves on top of the table on goal difference. Every team is dropping random games left and right, and it seems as though nobody wants to win the league this year. It’s not often we see a non-traditional top 6 team in first place for multiple weeks, and it’s even less often that we see four of those traditional six teams in 10th place or below. We’ve only seen one title win from a team outside of this group since 1995, so maybe it’s time to check in on these clubs and see how they are doing:

      <h10><b>Liverpool (2nd Place, Behind 1st On Goal Difference):</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The reigning champions seem to be the only traditional top-six team that looks capable of winning the title this season, though there have been hiccups. A disastrous 7-2 defeat to Aston Villa tanked their goal difference and a potentially season-ending injury to star defender Virgil Van Dijk weakens a defensive line that has already had troubles so far this season. Their expected goals against per 90 so far is 1.58, up about 50% from last season’s 1.05 per 90. Alisson is back, which will help quite a bit with their xGA underperformance (14 conceded from 9.5 xGA), but Van Dijk is such a crucial part of their defense that they will likely perform worse than before anyway. Thankfully for Liverpool, their offense is as good as ever - actually better than last season so far with 2.55 xG/90 up from 1.88. Even with the relative lack of production from Trent Alexander-Arnold, the offense has shown to be the best in the league by a healthy margin. If Liverpool can cope well without Van Dijk, we should see them lifting their second straight Premier League trophy at the end of the season.

      <h10><b>Tottenham (5th Place, 2 Points Behind 1st):</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Beware Harry Kane: Master Playmaker. Kane is making a nice comeback this season, with five goals and eight assists to his name through six games. Tottenham as a whole have had a nice start to the season so far. They had a big 6-1 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford - though home-field advantage doesn’t mean too much in the era of COVID. However, they have combined great results like that with Atlanta Falcons-esque choke jobs like their 3-3 draw with West Ham at home - a game they also lost on xG 2.1-1.2. So all-in-all, I don’t really know what to make of Tottenham at the moment. I still feel like they are a team in transition that’s overperforming a bit to start the season - for example, Son has scored 8 goals from 2.8 xG so don’t expect him to keep this up. But maybe Jose Mourinho has figured something out like he usually does in his second season and Spurs actually have a chance to challenge for the title this year. I don’t know. Maybe if I had watched the All or Nothing documentary I would have a bit more insight into what is going on with them. For now, I’ll be keeping a close eye on Tottenham to see if they can get back to their form of a couple of seasons ago.

      <h10><b>Chelsea (10th Place, 4 Points Behind 1st):</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        So Chelsea’s academy youth movement lasted all of about one season. The London club went and spent €250 million on new players, and as expected the team hasn’t quite gelled yet. There’s a combination of reasons for this: a shortened preseason, injuries to a number of players (old and new), and the fact that Frank Lampard just has not figured out what his best team is yet. That last point has had some problems in that there simply hasn’t been enough time with everyone healthy to see what works best, but even then Lampard has messed around with formations and personnel in the early weeks. He seems to have settled on some sort of 4-2-3-1, but Lampard hasn’t quite figured out how to jam all of his attacking talents into a team in a way that suits all of them. His insistence on shoehorning Mason Mount into lineups also hasn’t helped with that. Chelsea will likely get better as the season progresses and their players have time to gel, but Lampard needs to aid that cohesion by figuring out a system that gets the most out of his absurdly talented attacking roster.

      <h10><b>Arsenal (11th Place, 4 Points Behind 1st):</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        For the first time in a long time, Arsenal’s biggest problem is not their defense. No, Arsenal have a chance creation problem. They have scored 8 goals from an xG of 6.5 - both bottom half rankings for those metrics. Star forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has just one goal this season from an xG of 0.8, a pitiful return for a player that has scored 22 goals in each of the last two seasons. Arteta-ball seems to take the early 2010s Spanish national team approach to possession: do not actually use it to create chances like Pep Guardiola does with his Manchester City teams, instead use it to keep the ball away from the other team as much as possible to keep them from scoring. A fine idea, especially as most of Arsenal’s defenders are much better in possession than they are at, you know, defending, but it hasn’t totally paid off so far. Arsenal are still a midtable team defensively - with 7.9 xGA so far - so if they are going to improve this season the offense needs to kick it into gear. Really makes you wonder why they didn’t register Mesut Ozil.

      <h10><b>Manchester City (13th Place, 5 Points Behind 1st, 1 Game In Hand):</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Eventually, it was going to come crashing down for Manchester City. They are in a bit of a strange situation right now. On the one hand, they are in a bit of a transition period as much of their old core begins to leave. On the other hand, they still have way too much talent to be underperforming as much as they are. Yes, they’ve had some injuries, but on paper, they should still be one of if not the best team in the league. One thing that has really affected their performance this season is the absence of both Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus. Without them, City have just been a team of playmakers without anyone to play the final pass to. While Raheem Sterling and Phil Foden have done a decent job of getting shots off in decent positions, they don’t do it near as often as Jesus and they are nowhere near as good as Aguero at finishing off chances. As a result, despite the sometimes shaky performance of their defense, City’s biggest problem at the moment is the lack of goals. Expect to see them getting closer to the levels of the last few seasons when Jesus and Aguero return from injury, but for now, don’t be surprised to see them drop points when they seem to be dominating games.

      <h13>
        Oh, Manchester United. If Ed Woodward had just decided to bite the bullet and spend the extra €20 million on Jadon Sancho, perhaps you would be in the conversation for winning the league. Instead, he spent that money on a player that likely won’t be ready to start for at least another season or two. United’s form has been nosediving since the restart - despite what the results might suggest - and yet they did nothing this summer to fix some of the issues that led to that decline: the lack of a defensive midfielder that could cover for Pogba and Bruno’s attacking tendencies and a creative midfielder to help take some of the burden off of Bruno’s shoulders. Instead, they decided to spend €40 million on a player that plays in positions already occupied by Pogba and Bruno. Maybe Solksjaer has figured something out by switching to a 4-4-2 diamond system, but it’s only a matter of time before their fullbacks - who aren’t particularly good in possession - are exposed. United have a lot of work to do if they want to get back to challenging for the title, which is strange when they seemed just a piece or two away this summer.
