<!-- 1st Paragraph -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      As Gerrard Pique said after his club’s 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals, Barcelona have hit “rock bottom”. The Catalan club has gone trophyless for the first time since the 2013-2014 season, and the future isn’t looking too bright for the five-time European Champions. The club’s reliance on Lionel Messi cannot be overstated, and he is the only reason Barcelona grabbed a top-four spot in La Liga and made it to the Champions League quarterfinals. He has contributed an astounding 31 goals and 26 assists this season in 44 appearances, which are absolutely insane numbers for a 33 year old.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Another major issue that Barcelona faces is the lack of direction from their board of directors. For the past few years, the board has had a “galactico-esque” transfer policy, where they buy high-performing players for well above what they’re worth without consulting the current manager, who is left to fit the players into their squad. A prime example is Antione Griezmann, who has been forced to play on the left-wing this season, a position he is completely unfamiliar with. The board decided to buy Griezmann because of the weight his name carries in the football world, and because they believed that signing a big name striker would automatically equate to the team scoring more goals. Sadly, this was not true, and Griezmann only scored 9 La Liga goals in the 2019/2020 season, a poor tally for a player of his standards. Whether this is because he was playing out of position in a system that didn’t favor him, or he was destined to fail in any system that wasn’t Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid, it doesn’t matter. Barcelona’s board flushed away €110 million for a player who they are already trying to force out after only one year at the club.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The board is attempting to set up a situation of “the last stand,” where Lionel Messi and his band of superstars set out to win one final Champions League trophy. That’s why they traded Arthur for Miralem Pjanic, Arthur has more potential and will become a great player, but Pjanic is the better player at the present time. The Barcelona board wants to surround Messi with the best players possible, in the hopes that they can win their first Champions League since 2015. Following this policy, they have put more emphasis on buying talent as opposed to cultivating it in their famous La Masia academy, which has severely hurt the club.
At this time, 6 of Barcelona’s starting eleven are over 30 years old, and they have no replacements lined up for any of them. Much like their reliance on Messi, their reliance on their core group of starters has been immense. Soon enough, all of their aging players will have to leave the club, whether through a transfer due to a dip in quality or through retirement. When that time comes, Barcelona will have to go through a full squad overhaul, which, if done incorrectly, could ruin the club.
    </h13>

    <br></br>
    <h12><b>My Plan:</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Disclaimer: I am not a Barcelona fan. In fact, I’m the opposite. However, I did my best to remain objective in my analysis, and I tried to create what I believe to be the best plan of action in rebuilding Barcelona. Also, this is a rebuild, not what I believe Barcelona’s squad will look like next year. If you’re looking for a realistic squad prediction, click <a href="https://michigansoccersociety.com/blog/how-adama-traore-fits-in-liverpool-and-his-potential-replacements" style="color:#25528f"><u>here</u></a>.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I believe that there is a lot of deadweight in Barcelona’s locker room, and a squad overhaul is needed now. I plan on selling almost half of the squad, and building almost an entirely new team. The squad that I build will look very different from the squad now, and it may be a bit of a drop-off in quality at first. That being said, if the right coach is brought in to manage this team, it could easily become akin to Barcelona’s treble-winning squads of 2009 and 2015.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The first thing that I would do is completely restructure the club. I would make sure the board has a clear direction, and make sure all members are on board with the club’s vision. Anyone that I feel is holding us back will be released or voted out. At the very top, club president Josep Bartomeu will be voted out in the next election, if I cannot force him to resign immediately. On a lower level, the sacking of Sporting Director Eric Abidal was a good start, and I would try and appoint someone with ties to the club, and experience in club politics (maybe Frank Rijkaard or Patrick Kluivert).
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Barcelona have recently appointed ex-player Ronald Koeman as their manager. While he wouldn’t be my first choice, I am not completely against his appointment. Koeman is versatile, but he mostly favors all out possession, or direct counterattacks (when he is managing a team that doesn’t have the ability to play possession-based football). He also is huge into youth development, which will be a much-needed change back to how Barcelona used to be.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Finally, the transfer budget. As this is FC Barcelona, I will give myself a bit of room to work. I will get €100 million to work with, as well as whatever funds I bring in from selling players in the current squad. With all of that settled, let’s begin!

    <h12><b>The Squad:</b></h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/how-i-would-rebuild-barcelona/how-i-would-rebuild-barcelona-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b>Goalkeepers</b>: ter Stegen, Neto, Pena
      <br></br>
      <b>Defenders</b>: Pique, Lenglet, Umtiti, Todibo, Alba, Firpo, Roberto, Semedo, Wague
      <br></br>
      <b>Midfielders</b>: Busquets, de Jong, Puig, Rakitic, Alena, Vidal, Coutinho, Pjanic
      <br></br>
      <b>Forwards</b>: Messi, Dembele, Trincao, Griezmann, Suarez, Braithwaite, Fati, Pedri
      <br></br>

    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Who’s Getting Sold:</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      There were only six players that I wasn’t open to selling on Barcelona’s current squad: ter Stegen, Lenglet, de Jong, Puig, Pjanic (as he was just brought in), Trincao, and Fati. Everyone else was on the chopping block, and it just came down to what I thought was best.
      <br></br>

      <li>Neto: Sold to Chelsea for €15 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -Has been disappointing, and there is no reason to keep him around now that Pena is back from his loan.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Nelson Semedo: Traded to Manchester City in player swap deal</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -Never really fit in at Barcelona, a move to Manchester City will be good for both parties.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Gerard Pique: Sold to Napoli for €20 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -He’s gotten slow in his age, and it is time for the veteran center back to go. Barcelona rely too much on him in the back, and that will begin to cost them as he continues to decline. Give him a good sending off and let him keep his dignity.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Samuel Umtiti: Sold to Roma for €30 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -He’s too injury-prone for Barcelona, and they should cash in on him while he’s still worth something.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Junior Firpo: Sold to Chelsea for €20 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -Like Semedo, never really fit in at Barcelona. Feuding with Messi didn’t help him out either.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Ivan Rakitic: Sold to AC Milan for €15 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -It’s time to go for the Croatian. He’s too old to still be playing top-level football as a starter week in and week out and has already begun his decline.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Arturo Vidal: Sold to Crystal Palace for €10 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -Get him out. A bad locker room presence, and a thug on the field.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Ousmane Dembele: Sold to Manchester United for €70 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -I would take anything over €60 million for him. He has suffered greatly due to injuries, and that’s not something I want to have to worry about. Cash in on him while someone still wants him.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Luis Suarez: Sold to Ajax for €25 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -A great player, but it’s time to go. Let him make a sensational return to Ajax with his head held high.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Martin Braithwaite: Sold to West Ham for €15 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -I understand why Barcelona signed him last season (even though I don’t like it because it pretty much relegated Leganes), but he isn’t Barcelona quality. I saw he was linked with West Ham, and I couldn’t think of a more “classic West Ham” transfer than Martin Braithwaite.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Philippe Coutinho: Sold to Liverpool for €55 million</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -I honestly have no idea what club will take him, Liverpool is just a guess, but after Coutinho scored 2 goals against Barcelona in the Champions League, I don’t think he’ll be welcome in the squad.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <li>Lionel Messi: Sold to Manchester City in player+cash deal (€40 million)</li>
      <br>
      <h13>
        -Yeah, I would sell Messi. Barcelona’s reliance on him is bad for the club, and it’s time they had a new identity, rather than “Messi’s club.” It’s time to rip off the band-aid and get this over with. If Barcelona are truly rebuilding the club, they shouldn’t continue to rely on Messi post-rebuild. Give him a send-off ceremony worthy of a god, and let him light up the Premier League for the last few years of his career.
      </h13>
      <br></br>

      <b>
        Total made: €315 million
        <br></br>
        Transfer Budget: €415 million

    </h11>
    <br></br>

    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>The Squad Now/What We Need:</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b>Goalkeepers</b>: ter Stegen, Pena
      <br></br>
      <b>Defenders</b>: Lenglet, Todibo, Alba, Roberto, Wague
      <br></br>
      <b>Midfielders</b>: Busquets, de Jong, Puig, Alena, Pjanic
      <br></br>
      <b>Forwards</b>: Trincao, Griezmann, Fati, Pedri
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      First, I don’t believe the squad needs to sign a goalkeeper. I have confidence that Barcelona can find a capable goalkeeper in their academy, who will be suitable as a third-string.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In defense, Barcelona will need two center backs, one starter, and one backup. They also need a new backup left-back, and I’m looking for someone who will be able to take over the starting position when I sell Jordi Alba in the 2021 summer transfer window. The club needs a right-back, which will be taken care of in Nelson Semedo’s swap deal.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In midfield, I will make three signings. The first will be the heir to Sergio Busquets, who will be his understudy for the coming season, and then take over his position eventually (like Jordi Alba, I expect Busquets to leave in the summer 2021 transfer window). I will also buy a left and right midfielder, as the squad will now be playing in a 4-4-2 formation.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In attack, I will buy two strikers. One will be the starter alongside Antoine Griezmann, and the other will be a backup, who will be young with a lot of potential.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The main thing that will be needed from the signings is goals. Messi and Suarez combined for 41 league goals in the 2019/2020 season, almost half of the club’s total (86). The signings that are brought in will have to replicate these extraordinary numbers if Barcelona wants to continue to be a top club, so I tried to pick players that would maximize our goal output.
    </h13>

    <h12><b>Signings:</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h11><b>Joao Cancelo from Manchester City for Nelson Semedo</b></h11>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Cancelo’s time at Manchester City hasn’t been a huge success, and he hasn’t been able to steal the starting right-back position from Kyle Walker. As Cancelo is one of the best right-backs in the game, he won’t want to be a backup next season and will look for a team that can guarantee him a starting spot. Barcelona can offer him that, as they will be eager to pick up a right-back of his quality. He is a behemoth both defensively and in attack, as he ranks in the 98th percentile for tackles won and interceptions won, and in the 99th percentile for xGBuildup (expected goals per movement that the player has contributed to) and the 97th percentile for successful dribbles per match. If Barcelona were to sign him, he could become the true successor to legendary right-back Dani Alves.

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Barcelona have been linked with Gaya for a while now, and Valencia’s crisis only seems to add to the likelihood of Gaya joining the Blaugrana. Gaya is very similar to Jordi Alba (though his offensive contributions could use some work) and if Barcelona were to sign him, I would expect him to integrate perfectly into the squad, and eventually take over the mantle as starting left-back.

    <h11><b>Dayot Upamecano from RB Leipzig for €65 million</b></h11>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Upamecano looks like the perfect fit to be Barcelona’s long term center back, he checks off all of the boxes of a great defender. He is exceptional defensively, ranking in the 87th percentile for tackles won per match, as well as the 96th percentile for recoveries per match. His height is an added bonus to his defensive abilities, as he wins around 66% of the aerial duels he takes part in. His passing is also spectacular for a center back, he has around a 90% pass completion rate, as well as ranking in the 89th percentile for passes under pressure completed per match. It might take quite a lot of money to pry Upamecano away from Leipzig, but for a player of his abilities, it’ll be worth every penny.

    <h11><b>Malang Sarr on a free transfer</b></h11>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The former Nice defender had a great 2019/2020 season with the club, but due disagreements regarding his wages, he decided not to re-sign with them. I think he would be a great signing for Barcelona, as 1) he is free, and 2) he fits the mold for their center backs. Like Upamecano, he is a great passer of the ball, having a 90% pass completion rate in Ligue 1. He is also a great technical defender, averaging 3.81 interceptions and 9.63 recoveries per match. A free transfer for Sarr is a steal, and at 21 years old, Barcelona should try their hardest to snatch up this young talent, as he could be the long term future of the club’s center back position.

    <h11><b>Marc Roca from Espanyol for €20 million</b></h11>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      From what I have seen of Roca during his career at Espanyol, I believe that he would fit in perfectly at Barcelona. I think that his expert passing ability, especially his long passes (which he hits with around 70% accuracy) makes him suitable to fit into Barcelona’s possession-based system. Defensively, Roca is also fantastic, as he ranks above the 90th percentile in pressures, successful pressures, recoveries, and tackles won (all per 90 minutes played). I think that current Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets could mentor him during his last season at the club, and form Roca into one of the best holding midfielders in the world.

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I picked Bernardo for his incredible playmaking abilities. He ranks above the 90th percentile in shot-creating actions, expected assists, key passes, passes into the penalty area, and touches in the box (all per 90 minutes). His role in the squad, like Oyarzabal, will be to get the ball to the strikers in areas that allow them to score with ease. He will be the main creator in the squad, and the player that all attacks run through. He hasn’t received the attention he deserves at Manchester City, but if he came to Barcelona he would be the most important player.

    <h13>
      Oyarzabal was one of La Liga’s best players in the 2019-2020 season, scoring 10 goals and assisting 11. At only 23 years old, he has the potential to become one of the best wingers/midfielders in the world, and I think he would be the best option for the left midfield position in this Barcelona rebuild. His passing and dribbling are both exceptional, though his shooting could use a bit of work. It will be nearly impossible to replicate Messi’s goal and assist output, but I think that Oyarzabal and my next pick could come very close.

    <h11><b>Donyell Malen from PSV Eindhoven for €30 million</b></h11>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With Koeman now Barcelona’s manager, I had to sign at least one Dutchman. Malen had an incredible 2019/2020 season with PSV Eindhoven, where he scored 11 goals and assisted 5 in 14 Eredivisie appearances. The 21 year old would be an excellent backup striker for Barcelona for the next few seasons before he takes over as a starter. He could be a force off of the bench, and there’s no doubt that he would get playing time due to his links with Koeman.

      Finally, we have the big-money signing. After his 2019/2020 season (where he scored 14 goals in 35 Serie A matches), I believe that he is ready to make the move to Barcelona. He is an expert finisher, ranking in the 98th percentile for both expected (non-penalty) goals and shots per match, as well as ranking in the 99th percentile for the number of touches taken in the opponent’s penalty area per match. I think that a partnership between him and Antoine Griezmann (with service from Bernardo Silva and Mikel Oyarzabal) could prove to be very successful.

      The team looks great, aside from the lack of a holding midfielder. Pjanic and de Jong will have to both track back often and contribute heavily defensively. They won’t mind this as they are both adept defenders. The attack, however, looks blistering. Griezmann and Martinez backed by Bernardo and Oyarzabal would be a sight to see, and I’m sure that they would terrorize opposition defenses. If Barcelona were to make these signings, I’m sure they would return to their trophy-winning days, and re-establish themselves as one of football’s best teams.
