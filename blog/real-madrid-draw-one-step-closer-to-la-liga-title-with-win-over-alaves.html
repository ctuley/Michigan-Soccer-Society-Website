      <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 2-0 Alaves</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It took goals from Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio for Madrid to beat relegation-battling Alaves, in what was a truly end-to-end match. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Zidane’s Makeshift Defense Keeps Clean Sheet</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With Ramos and Carvajal suspended after the match against Athletic Club, and Nacho and Marcelo out due to injuries, Zidane had few options to field in his back line against Alaves. He opted for Varane and Militao at center back, Ferland Mendy in the left back spot, and winger Lucas Vazquez at right back. While this defense did keep a clean sheet against Alaves, they were tested frequently and were lucky not to concede. In the 3rd minute of the match, Lucas Perez headed the ball into the crossbar, and then forced Varane into making a goal-line clearance with his follow-up shot. Throughout the match, Thibaut Courtois was relied on to clean up any mistakes made by the defense, and he did very well, adding on to his streak of clean sheets (he has not conceded a goal in 457 minutes, and is nearing ter Stegen’s 500 minute record).

      <h10><b>2. Lucas Vazquez (The Right Back) Is Not Real Madrid Quality</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Lucas looked very out of place on Friday night. It has been quite a long time since the winger had been deployed at the right back spot, and he played cagey - being caught out of position multiple times. The only positive to his performance against Alaves was how he bombed forward in attack, which helped pin Alaves deep in their own end. In my prediction for Real Madrid’s 2020/2021 squad, I said that Los Blancos should keep Vazquez, and I still stand by that, but I firmly take the stance that he should never play right back again. I would have much rather had Javi Hernandez start at center back against Alaves and move Militao out to right back.

                Benzema scored and assisted on Friday night, bringing his tally to 18 goals and 8 assists this season. Even though his stats have been great this season, they understate Benzema’s importance to this Real Madrid team. He leads the team from the front, and his mentality and attitude are so influential to the other players. Assuming that Real Madrid win the title (they are 4 points ahead of second-placed Barcelona with 3 matches left to be played) and he is the top scorer and assister of the team, he has a serious shot to usurp Lionel Messi for the Player of the Year honor. Benzema did limp off the field in the 82nd minute, and Madrid fans will be hoping their striker will be available for the match against Granada on Monday.

      <h10><b>4. Alaves Still Above Relegation, But Not Safe Yet</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Even after their loss against Real Madrid, Alaves are still above the relegation zone, but only by 3 points. As their final three matches of the season are against Getafe, Real Betis, and Barcelona, it’s tough to see them adding any more points to their tally of 35. They will need to play their best football of the season if they want to avoid playing in La Liga Smartbank next season. They’ll be looking to star strikers Lucas Perez (11 goals this season) and Joselu (10 goals) to spur them to victory.

              <h13>
                In the 10th minute of the match, Ferland Mendy was taken down by Ximo Navarro after the French defender broke through on goal. The touch on Mendy was a bit soft, but it was still a touch, and VAR ruled it a penalty. That makes it three matches in a row that Real Madrid’s game-winning goal was a penalty, but this time it’s less of an issue as Madrid scored again. Even though each time Real Madrid has received a penalty it has been for a legitimate foul, opposition fans will feel that VAR has favored Madrid this season, and will be looking for La Liga officials to revise their use of the technology for next season.
