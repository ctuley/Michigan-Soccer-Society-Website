      <h12><b>Final Score: Chelsea 3 - 3 Southampton</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Frank Lampard’s men were shocked by Southampton on Saturday at Stamford Bridge. The entertaining match was full of goals and opportunities for both sides, and the Saints surely deserved a point for their effort. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. A Timo Werner Masterclass</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Timo Werner has impressed during his first season in England but was still looking for his first goal in the Premier League entering Saturday. His goal versus Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, as well as his consistent runs on and off the ball, were enough to keep Chelsea fans happy, but he needed to get on the scoresheet in the league to really ease everyone’s nerves at Stamford Bridge. The German showed up in style against Southampton, scoring two world-class goals and providing an assist to his fellow countryman Kai Havertz. There was never a doubt that Werner would be Chelsea’s first-choice striker at the start of the season, but his performance on Saturday will certainly please Frank Lampard as he is finally getting the production he expected from his expensive forward.

      <h10><b>2. Chelsea’s Front Four Is Insanely Fun To Watch</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Chelsea fans finally got to see their four first-choice attackers play together and it was a sight to see indeed. Werner and Havertz were joined by the now fit Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech and the four men provided many brilliant moments on Saturday. Werner led the way with two goals and an assist while Havertz dominated the midfield with his quick movements and clean passes, also adding a goal in the second half. Pulisic was given his first start of the season after recovering from injury and displayed his skill and pace throughout the day, most notably through his link up with Werner that led to Havertz’s goal. Ziyech was given a cameo at the end of the match as he too is recovering from injury, but the Morrocan showed hints of his wizardry with a few of his iconic long balls and his quick feet. The front four will get plenty of playing time together assuming they can all stay fit, and they will need to be in top form in the coming weeks as Chelsea begin their Champions League campaign next week and face Manchester United in their next league match.

      <h10><b>3. Valiant Effort From Hassenhüttl’s Men</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Getting a point at Stamford Bridge is never an easy task, and it is certainly an accomplishment for a club like Southampton. Ralph Hassenhüttl has done a great job managing Southampton in his short spell with the club, and Saturday’s result against Chelsea has to be one of his biggest with the Saints. The credit goes to his players, who pressured Chelsea into making errors and capitalized on these errors for all three of their goals. Despite being down two within the first 30 minutes, Southampton fought back and leveled the match early in the second half with goals from strikers Danny Ings and Ché Adams. A stoppage-time goal from Jannik Vestergaard completed the comeback and gave Southampton a point in a match they were expected to lose. Chelsea’s defense was once again forgettable on Saturday, with key errors from Kurt Zouma and Kepa Arrizabalaga, but Hassenhüttl has to be pleased with his players’ fight and determination. He’ll be hoping they can carry this performance into their matchup with league leaders Everton next weekend.

      <h10><b>4. Ben Chilwell: Chelsea’s Left-Back</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Who is Chelsea’s left-back? This question has been on every Chelsea fan’s mind since Frank Lampard’s arrival as manager in July 2019. Marcos Alonso and Emmerson are solid attacking threats on the left flank but lack the defensive ability expected of a Premier League defender, while César Azpilicueta can’t consistently play on the left side of the field as a right-footed player. Lampard seems to have found the answer to Chelsea’s left-back problem in Ben Chilwell, who can provide elite attacking support on the left side while also defending when needed. Southampton had no answers for Chilwell in the first half as the Englishman assisted Werner’s opener and played multiple brilliant balls into the box. Lampard may ask his new left-back to sit back and defend more in the coming weeks as Chelsea’s center-backs continue to struggle, but Chilwell will look to continue his development into a star left-back, something Chelsea haven’t truly had since the departure of Ashley Cole in 2014.

      <h10><b>5. Danny Ings Impresses Again</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Danny Ings has completely revived his career at Southampton following an injury-filled spell at Liverpool. The 28-year-old, who tied Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for second in Premier League goals last season, gave the Saints hope with his goal late in the first half and had many of Southampton’s best chances in the second half. When Ings plays as he did against Chelsea, he gives his side the ability to compete against the top sides in the league. His play will be instrumental in how high Southampton finish in the table this season, as some believe the club can possibly challenge for a Europa League spot. Southampton will have a great season by their standards if Ings can continue this run of form, and the Englishman may attract the attention of Gareth Southgate and receive a national team call-up for next summer’s European Championship.
