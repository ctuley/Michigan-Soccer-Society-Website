    <h12><b>Final Score: Everton 2 - 2 Liverpool</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In an action packed and scrappy game, Liverpool and Everton tied 2-2. Everton came into the game on a seven game win streak and Liverpool lost their previous game 7-2 to Aston Villa, but it was Liverpool who took the lead after three minutes through Sadio Mane. After a controversial challenge by Jordan Pickford on Virgil Van Dijk, Michael Keane scored off of a corner kick to tie the game before halftime. In a more back-and-forth second half, a fantastic one timed finish by Mohammad Salah gave Liverpool the lead before a towering header by Dominic Calvert-Lewin brought the teams level once more. Richarlison was sent off for a reckless tackle after the whistle, and Liverpool thought they had won the game in extra time but a controversial VAR decision ruled Sadio Mane offside. Following the result, Everton remained in first place. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Keane Stars For Everton Once Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After a shaky spell under previous manager Marco Silva, English center back Michael Kene has found his confidence and form under Carlo Ancelotti. Commanding the back line, especially after the injury to captain Seamus Coleman, Keane was a steadying presence for the Toffees throughout the game. Although he was always known for having a strong aerial presence, Keane also demonstrated his newly developed passing ability and constantly made progressive chipped passes to the wingers and fullbacks. Further demonstrating his attacking prowess, Keane even scored Everton’s first goal with a bullet header. Under Ancelotti Keane looks like he has the potential to be an upper tier Premier League defender, and was rewarded during the international break with his first England call up in a long time.

    <h10><b>2. New Member Of Liverpool Midfield Shines</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Earning his first start, new signing Thiago struggled in the first 15 minutes of the game. However, he quickly grew into the game and brought a smoothness to the Liverpool midfield that meshed well with Jordan Henderson and Fabinho’s industry. In the first half, he found Salah and Andrew Robertson with multiple long diagonal balls. Later, he used this threat to disguise a perfectly weighted pass down the middle to Roberto Firmino which led to a good chance, and an almost identical pass to Mane led to what Liverpool thought was the winning goal. Despite not adding the winning goal, Liverpool have signed a world class dribbler and passer, and will not lose a step even if Giorginio Wijnaldum leaves the club.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>3. Pickford Inconsistent Once Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While not at fault for either of the two goals, enigmatic Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was once again in the spotlight. Although it was unclear whether he made an attempt on the ball, Pickford slammed into Virgil Van Dijk in the penalty area and appeared to be in danger of receiving a red card, but was unpenalized. After this moment of madness, Pickford made a series of stunning saves, highlighted by a diving save to his right on a Matip header which held Liverpool’s lead to one goal. In spite of the earlier challenge, Pickford had finally seemed to have refound his form. However, in second half extra time, Pickford once again allowed a soft shot to slip under him after Jordan Henderson ran onto a Sadio Mane cross. Although the goal was ruled offside, both Everton fans and England manager Gareth Southgate will wonder if Pickford’s continuous mistakes are a permanent problem.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Robertson Brilliant In Attack</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Once again, star Liverpool left back Andrew Robertson was a focal point of Liverpool’s offense. Unlike his fullback partner Trent Alexander-Arnold who had to contend with the speedy Richarlison, Robertson was matched up with the prolific but slow James Rodriguez. Without fear of a counter attack, Roberton was able to stay forward and consistently led Liverpool’s attack down the left side. In addition to his trademark first-time crosses, he highlighted his dribbling during Liverpool’s first goal by knocking the ball around Seamus Coleman before delivering a perfect cross for Mane. Throughout the match Robertson was dangerous and progressive, and Liverpool will hope that the injury he sustained in the second half was only minor.

    <h10><b>5. Everton’s Fluid Midfield</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Often overmatched last season, Everton’s new look midfield continued their impressive run of form. In Ancelotti’s 4-3-3 formation, all of Everton’s center midfielders, Andre Gomes, Allan, and Abdoulaye Doucore, are asked to fulfill a variety of goals. At some times, each midfielder led a high pressure against Liverpool’s back line, while at others, they dropped alongside Everton’s two center backs. Because each has a well rounded skill set, they can move throughout the pitch and interchange places in order to maintain a balanced side. Although they may not pile up high goal or assist numbers, Everton’s midfielders have become the key to their team’s resurgence, and appear to have given Everton the spine of a team ready to challenge the big six.
