  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Barcelona are in a really, REALLY bad spot right now. The kind of spot where the loyal-to-a-fault Lionel Messi wants to leave. There will undoubtedly be a lot of moves happening in Catalonia this summer, as Barcelona will want to add some new faces to their squad, and rid themselves of some deadweight. In this article I will be providing my predictions for their squad next season, not what transfers they should make to rebuild the club (that will come in another article). Let’s get into it!

  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Marc-Andre ter Stegen: (Keep)</b></u> He has arguably been Barcelona’s best player behind Messi this season, and is the best goalkeeper in the world when he’s at his best. He’s kept 14 clean sheets in 36 appearances, and has bailed out Barca’s defense numerous times. Barcelona need to keep him at all costs.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Neto: (Sell)</b></u> He’s made only 4 appearances this season, and hasn’t impressed for Barcelona. He’s too good to be a backup, and he should go looking for first team football elsewhere. At 30 years old, he still has a few good years left, and Barcelona should cash in and try and get some money out of him.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Inaki Pena: (Keep)</b></u> He’s been good for Barcelona B, keeping 8 clean sheets in 18 games. Expect him to play back-up for ter Stegen, as well as start some cup competition matches. He is the future of Barcelona’s goalkeeper position, and he should start to get first team game time next season.

<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Gerard Pique: (Keep)</b></u> The veteran defender has been one of Barcelona’s better players this past season, and there is no reason the Catalans should sell him. I expect him to stay at Barcelona until his contract expires in 2022.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Clement Lenglet: (Keep)</b></u> Barcelona’s best defender this season, and a highly underrated player. I expect the 25 year old to be the rock in Barcelona’s back line for many years to come.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Samuel Umtiti: (Sell if possible)</b></u> This one is 50/50 for me. I think that Barcelona wants to sell him, and that they will certainly try, but I don’t know if there will be any buyers in the current market. The only team that I can see taking him is PSG, with Thiago Silva leaving, unless Barcelona lists him for a very reduced price.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Jean-Clair Todibo: (Sell to Schalke)</b></u> The young Frenchman has been fine for Schalke during his short loan, and I believe that they will attempt to sign him permanently. As Barcelona are trying to build funds this summer, I expect they will let him go for any offer more than 15 million Euros.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Sergi Roberto: (Keep)</b></u> The right back (and midfielder) is Barcelona’s best squad player, something that even the biggest clubs need. He has made 30 La Liga appearances for the Catalans this season, and his versatility is a huge asset to the team. He is one of Barcelona’s most underrated players, and they would suffer greatly if they sold him.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Jordi Alba: (Keep)</b></u> One of Barcelona’s most consistent players over the past few years, Jordi Alba will not leave this summer. I expect his playing time to begin to wane this season, as he is 31 years old, but I think he will be Barcelona’s first choice left back for 2020-2021.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Junior Firpo: (Keep)</b></u> Even though he hasn’t impressed in his first season in Barcelona, and he has feuded with some of the clubs top players (Messi), I expect him to get another chance next season. However, if he fails to capitalize on this second chance, I believe that Messi will demand that he is sold in the winter transfer window.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Moussa Wague: (Loan)</u></b> His loan spell at Nice was cut short due to COVID-19, but it wasn’t unsuccessful. He made 5 appearances in the 7 matches that he was available for Nice, mostly as a right midfielder. I suspect that Barcelona will be eager to loan him out again to increase his market value, so they can sell him for a larger sum next summer.
    </h13>

        <div class="card-articles">
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Nelson Semedo: (Player swap to Manchester City)</b></u> The Portuguese international has spent 3 years with Barcelona, and it feels like they have been trying to offload him the entire time. In all fairness, Semedo hasn’t been bad for the Blaugranes, but he had impossible standards to live up to, replacing the legendary Dani Alves. I suspect that Barcelona will agree to a swap deal trading Semedo for Manchester City’s Joao Cancelo.
          </h13>
          <br></br>

          <h13>
            <b><u>Joao Cancelo: (Player swap from Manchester City)</u></b> Cancelo’s time at Manchester City hasn’t been a success, as he’s only made 15 Premier League appearances and contributed 0 goals and assists to the team. As Pep has favored Kyle Walker over him for most of the season, Cancelo will be looking for a new beginning where he can be guaranteed play time, and Barcelona can give him that.

      Midfielders:

  </div>
</section>



<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Sergio Busquets: (Keep)</b></u> He’s been with Barcelona since 2005, and I don’t expect him to leave now. He plays a role for Barcelona that no other player can fill, and I expect Barcelona will want to keep him at least until his contract expires in 2023.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Frenkie de Jong: (Keep)</b></u> He has played well for Barcelona in his first season, but he hasn’t been able to replicate the spectacular form he had with Ajax in the 2018/19 season. He has put up a meager 2 goals and 2 assists in 29 La Liga appearances this season, which can be chalked up to adjusting to a new style of football. Beyond statistics, he has played well in the majority of his matches, and he is definitely the future of Barcelona’s midfield.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Arturo Vidal: (Keep)</b></u> The Chilean has played in 33 of Barcelona’s La Liga matches this season, scoring 8 goals and assisting 2. The 33 year old has one year left on his contract at Barcelona, and I don’t see any reason Barcelona wouldn’t want to offer him a new contract, if he wants to stay. Vidal is electric, a game changer, which is something that Barcelona sorely needs right now.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Ivan Rakitic: (Sell)</b></u> This is a bold prediction, and I’m not too sure about it. I think that Barcelona wants to sell Rakitic, but like Umtiti, there may not be any interested buyers. The 32 year old has been one of Barcelona’s best midfielders of the past few years, and if Barcelona are forced to keep him they won’t be too disappointed.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Arthur: (Sold to Juventus)</b></u> I see the logic behind giving Arthur to Juventus to get Pjanic, but it just feels like a bad move. Giving up one of the most talented young midfielders in the world so that you can get one who is 30 years old (and at the end of his prime) is just stupid. I understand that Barcelona are only focusing on winning the Champions League before Messi leaves, but is Pjanic really really going to improve this Barcelona squad that much?
    </h13>
    <img src="../blog-img/predicting-barcelonas-squad-for-the-2020-21-season/predicting-barcelonas-squad-for-the-2020-21-season-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: en.as.com</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Miralem Pjanic: (Bought from Juventus)</b></u> I like Pjanic, I think he’s a great player. I just don’t see how he fits into this Barcelona team. I see Pjanic as a deep-lying playmaker, someone who will get the ball to the forwards quickly as soon as his team wins the ball. I don’t see how he fits into Barcelona’s midfield, as they already have Sergio Busquets and Frenkie de Jong, who combine to fill this role. The only way that I can see Pjanic being successful is if Barcelona plays in a 4-4-2 diamond, where Messi or Riqui Puig plays in an attacking midfield role, with Pjanic and de Jong play as box-to-box midfielders, and Busquets sits in front of the back line.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Carles Alena: (Loan)</b></u> Alena’s loan at Real Betis for the second half of the 2019/20 season could be considered a success, as he made 17 appearances in La Liga, and scored 1 goal. The young Spaniard needs more experience, and another loan will be good for him.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Riqui Puig: (Keep)</b></u> Puig drifted between the first team and Barcelona B, and he has greatly impressed for both. I believe that he will stay with the first team next season and fight for a starting place, which he will probably earn. This kid is very talented, and I expect him to blossom into a great player.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Rafinha: (Sell/loan to Celta Vigo)</b></u> The Brazilian spent last season on loan with Celta, where he contributed 4 goals and 1 assist in 29 La Liga appearances. I expect the club to sign him to another loan or on a permanent contract, as he seemed to fit in well with their squad.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Philippe Coutinho: (Player swap to Arsenal)</b></u> I think that Coutinho will return to the Premier League in the 2020/21 season, but I’m not sure which club he’ll go to (Arsenal makes sense just based on this player swap deal). He never really worked out at Barcelona (because he was played out of position) or Bayern Munich, and I think he will want to return to the league that he has been successful in before. Arsenal need a quality attacking midfielder, and Coutinho can definitely fit that role.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Matteo Guendouzi: (Player swap from Arsenal)</b></u> Guendouzi to Barcelona looks increasingly more likely, as Mikel Arteta looks determined to get rid of him in the transfer window. Guendouzi has an attitude issue, and he definitely needs a fresh start at a new club. He is certainly talented, but it will be interesting to see (if he signs for Barcelona) how he deals with having to fight for a starting place in one of the most talented squads in the world.

        <div class="card-articles">
          <h13>
            <b><u>Lionel Messi: (Keep)</b></u> A few months ago I would have left this portion blank, because I believed that Messi would never leave Barcelona. Now, things are beginning to change. Messi seems to be getting more and more fed up with both this Barcelona board and team, and it is looking increasingly likely that he will leave. I do believe he will leave, but not in this transfer window. I assume it will be once his contract is up next summer, and Messi will be free to sign for any team he wants.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Luis Suarez: (Keep)</b></u> The Uruguayan struggled with injuries this past season, but still managed to score 16 goals and assist 8 in La Liga. Barcelona will surely keep him for the next season, as they are trying to put together the best squad to surround Lionel Messi, and Messi and Suarez combine very well.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Antoine Griezmann: (Sell if possible)</b></u> This was a poor buy from Barcelona last season, and it was made worse when they played Griezmann out of position. He only scored 9 goals in La Liga this year, a poor tally by the Frenchman’s standards. If any team offers more than 70 million Euros for Griezmann, Barcelona should take it, but I don’t see any team submitting an offer in this financial climate.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Ansu Fati: (Keep)</b></u> The 17 year old has been stunning for Barcelona this season, and they would be stupid to sell him. He has the ability to change a game, so I don’t believe that Barcelona will send him on loan, so I think he’ll be used consistently as a 60th minute substitute.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Ousmane Dembele: (Sell)</b></u> The young Frenchman spent most of last season injured, making only 5 appearances in La Liga. He seems to be always linked with Premier League teams (mainly Manchester United and Liverpool) and Barcelona seems to want to get rid of him due to his lack of discipline. Dembele is known to be out late partying and show up to training late, and this is not tolerated by the Barcelona coaching staff. Due to his injury issues and behavioral problems, I expect Barcelona to sell Dembele this summer.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h13>
      <b><u>Martin Braithwaite: (Sell)</b></u> Braithwaite hasn’t really served his purpose for Barcelona, as he was brought in to be a replacement for the injured Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele. He scored 1 goal in 11 La Liga appearances for Barcelona, a poor tally (not that I expected much, he’s a great player, but not Barcelona quality). If Barcelona were generous (which they aren’t) they would sell Braithwaite back to Leganes for a very small price, as Barcelona buying Braithwaite from them outside the transfer window contributed heavily to them being relegated. I don’t expect this to happen, but I do think that he will leave this summer, probably to a smaller La Liga club.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Lautaro Martinez: (Buy from Inter Milan)</b></u> He seems to be Barcelona’s main target this summer, and I believe that they will get him. I don’t know where he fits into this Barcelona team, as they already have two world class strikers in Griezmann and Suarez, and I don’t think that he will be comfortable sitting on the bench or rotating with them. Barcelona will have to change their style of play to fit him, and they may have to change their formation, but if Messi wants Lautaro at Barcelona, Lautaro will end up with the Catalans.

      <b><u>Quique Setien: (Out)</b></u> I have no good things to say about him, his tenure at Barcelona has been horrible. If the board does anything this summer, they should sack Setien and replace him with…
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Xavi: (Sign)</b></u> Even though Xavi hasn’t shown any real managerial genius (10-2-5 this season in the Qatari League) he seems to be Barcelona’s first choice to be their next manager. This is due to his history at the Catalan Club and his chemistry with the players, especially Lionel Messi. Barcelona’s board seems to believe that the best way that they can reclaim their former glory is to bring in a manager that is a Blaugrana through and through. Last time they appointed a former player who had spent most of their career at Barcelona, they won the treble.
