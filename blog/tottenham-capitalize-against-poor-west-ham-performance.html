    <h12><b>Final Score: Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 0 West Ham United</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Spurs defeated West Ham in an underwhelming London Derby, keeping them in contention for European qualification. Meanwhile, West Ham’s fight for survival intensifies.

    <h10><b>1. West Ham Put in Relegation-Worthy Performance</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The West Ham squad has some relatively big names, and to someone who doesn’t watch them play often, it might be surprising to see that they sit 17th in the table, level on points with Bournemouth in 18th. However, today’s performance perfectly demonstrated why West Ham have earned so few points. West Ham played a dreadful 90 minutes.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Mark Noble was not a reliable captain nor central midfielder, Michail Antonio seemed to be completely isolated upfront, and no one (minus Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen) showed any passion. Questions should be asked of Felipe Anderson, the team’s best attacker, who only played for about 20 minutes and failed to make an impact. If West Ham finishes the season in this style, it is inevitable that they will be playing in the Championship come next year.

            We had the chance to see the classic Spurs attack of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura, and Dele Alli, and wow, is that a talented front line. With Giovani Lo Celso in a slightly deeper role and with Steven Bergwijn coming off the bench, defending against Spurs is an absolute nightmare for back-lines. While today was not a perfect display, the front-line is multi-layered and dangerous. Dele pulls the strings from attacking midfield while Lucas Moura burns defenders with his pace. Son is an incredibly dynamic player, offering support in build-up play and proving he is a reliable finisher, while Kane is a lethal number nine. Near the tail end of the match, Bergwijn takes advantage of tired legs. The options are frightening and although the performance against West Ham was not flawless when the attack clicks, there are few better in the league.

            Arsenal’s long-lasting center-back dilemma has not improved, and a combination of injury and disciplinary issues against Manchester City only made it worse. Mikel Arteta will be eager for Frechman William Saliba to arrive later this summer and may look to spend big on another center-back before the start of next season.

    <h10><b>3. Fitness an Issue for Both Sides</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      By the end of the match, very few players on the pitch seemed to have much gas left in the tank. Spurs did a fine job keeping their shape, but only Stephen Bergwijn and Serge Aurier—who, it should be noted, put in a quality shift at right-back—appeared to have enough energy to maintain a high level of play. On the contrary, West Ham seemed to have fallen apart by the end of the match, with fatigue being much more harmful to them than to Spurs. The backline and midfield became stretched, allowing Spurs to launch a series of threatening counterattacks. West Ham are lucky not to have lost by three or four goals.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Questions have also been asked about Jose Mourinho’s tactics since the restart. Under the revised rules, teams can now make five substitutions per match, However, Mourinho has made a total of five changes across the past two matches, which may indicate a lack of faith in the squad. After all, Spurs don’t have the greatest depth. Interestingly, David Moyes only made two changes himself in a relatively boring contest between two sides who need as many points as they can get right now.

    <h10><b>4. Kane Unconvincing Despite Scoring</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Harry Kane has faced recent media criticism as a result of his injury issues and lack of goalscoring form. José Mourinho defended him, and against West Ham, Kane answered said criticism in typical Harry Kane style: by scoring a goal. However, his goal does not necessarily tell the full story of his outing. He had a few chances and took part in some build-up play, but all in all, while he’s still a fantastic striker, he was not overly involved against a weak opponent. He just still does not seem like the player he was before he got injured last season. Kane’s role at Spurs and in the England squad is not yet negotiable, but he will be under a microscope for the remainder of the campaign.
    </h13>

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Declan Rice Has a Big Future</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The only West Ham player who demonstrated any quality and seemed to work hard for the full 90 minutes was Declan Rice, a 21-year-old English international midfielder. Rated man of the match by WhoScored, Rice was all over the pitch putting in tackles and trying to move the ball forward. He was truly the bright spot among a depleted West Ham side and is being handed a lot of responsibility at such a young age. It seems destined for Rice to make a big move to a top Premier League club in the next few years, especially as he fights for a place in a competitive England squad. If West Ham are relegated, expect that move to happen much sooner—this summer, that is.
