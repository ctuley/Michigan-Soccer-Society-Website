      <h12><b>Final Score: Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After a seven goal thriller last week, Sadio Mane and Liverpool returned to form, manhandling a flat-footed Chelsea club - that looked eerily similar to their displays last September - with a 2-0 victory. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Fabinho the Centerback</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Liverpool’s defensive record last year was the best in the Premiership, but there were games that put that title into question, as they would get caught on the back foot or struggle in breaking down team and give up cheap goals on the break. After giving up three to Leeds last week, Jurgen Klopp decided to stick Fabinho next to Virgil Van Dijk in an effort to shore up the backline. Fabinho has previously played center-back in his career and for Klopp, so this is something that he is used to. Today, he was definitely comfortable in that role. He led both teams with 4 interceptions and had 4 tackles to go along with it, including 2 against Timo Werner in the 1st half that shut down Chelsea’s offense. It should not be a huge surprise to see him in that role as the year continues.

      <h10><b>2. Front Line Comes Through Again</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Last week, Mohamed Salah provided a brilliant hat trick for Liverpool, being the driving force for Liverpool’s first win. This week, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane took over that role. Mane had a very quiet first half, but towards the end of it, he started making waves. First, he made a beautiful run between both of Chelsea’s center backs that resulted in Andreas Christensen being sent off. He struck again in the 50th minute on a beautiful cross by Roberto Firmino, who flicked the ball into the area off of a one-two with Salah on the right-hand side. Mane got across the body of Reece James and drilled the ball into the far left side of the net, out of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga’s reach. Then in the 54th minute, he played a poor pass to Andrew Robertson but recovered to intercept a pass from Kepa right across the face of the net and drilled the loose ball home with no trouble. He had two goals on three shots, all on target, and came second on the team with 3 tackles, showing off the effectiveness of the high pressing mentality of the Liverpool front line. If anyone added to that mentality, it was definitely Firmino. Following a year where he had some questionable offensive performances and rumors of Liverpool buying other strikers, Firmino showed off the traits that made him such a great defensive striker. He dominated the press, making Chelsea’s backline uncomfortable and unable to deliver the ball into their midfielders. He had 3 key passes, the main one being his cross to Mane for the opening goal of the game. Overall, Mane and Firmino excelled in generating offense from defense today and showed off the game plan that made Liverpool English and European champions.

      <h10><b>3. Dominant Midfield Does It Again</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After this week, it is safe to say Liverpool has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to deciding their midfield 3. To start today, Klopp had long time skipper Jordan Henderson as the midpoint in the midfield with Georginio Wijnaldum and Naby Keita on the flanks, two hard-working midfielders that can provide an offensive spark to their defensive mindset. After Henderson walked off the field lame at the end of the first half, Klopp brought in the new signing Thiago, signed from Bayern, to be the creative force, before later bringing on the veteran James Milner for Keita. Thiago, Wijnaldum, Keita, and Milner all had at least 40 completed passes with an accuracy of above 90%, with Thiago providing 83 passes to go along with 10/12 accuracy on long balls. Henderson had the key long ball that resulted in Chelsea winding up with 10 men for the entire second half, and Wijnaldum showed off his attacking prowess with 4 shots, one on target. Last year, a big part of Liverpool’s poor performance in the Champions League and continental cups had to do with poor midfield play following an injury to Henderson. As the season progresses, it is going to be interesting to see if their newly reinforced midfield can pick up the slack if anyone was to go down again.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. Sarri Was Right</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When former Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri attempted to sub goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga off in the EFL Cup final back in 2019, I don’t think he imagined it would be the perfect metaphor for Kepa’s Chelsea career. Even though Kepa keeps coming out in the green Chelsea kit, he should no longer be their number one keeper. After posting the lowest save percentage in the Premier League last season, and struggling with saving outside the box shots, this season was viewed by many as his final opportunity to show himself as Chelsea's best option. He flopped at that chance today. He looked panicky against the front press of Liverpool, missing passes and often having to clear the ball in an attempt to counterpunch their press. In the second half, a disastrous error led to the second goal, where he tried to pass to Jorginho as Mane closed in on him and ended up serving Mane a perfect ball to slot home. With the transfer of Rennes goalie Edouard Mendy, it appears that Kepa's reign in Chelsea is officially over, or so Chelsea fans hope.

      <h10><b>5. Watch Out For Werner</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a quiet and poor offensive afternoon for Chelsea, Timo Werner showed off the skills that made him a dominant player at Leipzig. His speed was shown off several times, as he made great runs in an attempt to get behind Van Dijk and Fabinho. He led both teams with 5 successful dribbles and got into some good spots around the box, including a shot with his left foot that just dragged wide of Alisson. Chelsea had most of their success coming when they played long balls to Werner and allowed him to run the balls down and try to create some 1 on 1’s with defenders. If Werner keeps getting those same opportunities as the year progresses, he is going to catapult into the elite of Premier League attackers.
