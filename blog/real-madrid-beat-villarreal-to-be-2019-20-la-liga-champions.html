      <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 2-1 Villarreal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        A brace from Karim Benzema was enough to lift Los Blancos over Villareal, crowning them champions of La Liga for the first time since 2017. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Champions In Fantastic Form</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Thursday night’s win made it 30 points from the 10 matches since the restart for Zidane’s men. They have kept 6 clean sheets out of the ten matches, and maintained a goal differential of +15. This defence has been one of the best in La Liga history, conceding 23 goals in 37 matches (0.62 goals against per match, the best of any team in Europe). No one can deny that they deserved this title, as no team has come close to them based on performance this season.

      <h10><b>2. A Different Kind Of Penalty Controversy For Real Madrid</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Real Madrid had another controversial penalty in their match against Villarreal. This time, I won’t even talk about if it was a foul or not, but how the penalty was taken. Madrid’s usual taker, Sergio Ramos stepped up to take it, and once the referee blew the whistle, he passed it off to Karim Benzema, who finished the easy tap-in (Henry and Pires-esque). Once the players had celebrated, it was revealed that Benzema had entered the penalty box before Ramos had touched the ball, and the penalty was recalled. The Villarreal players expected to have possession, as Ramos did not score off of the penalty, and a Madrid player encroached on the play, meaning it should have been Villarreal’s ball. However, Madrid were given a re-take, and Karim Benzema slotted it home to complete his brace. I’m sure the referee made the right call, it was just not apparent why he gave Madrid a retake when watching the match, and no explanation was given.

      <h10><b>3. A Modric Masterclass</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Gareth Bale has not appeared for Zidane’s side since his start against Mallorca on June 24th. Since then, he has been on the bench each match, but has remained an unused substitute. Zidane seems to be more concerned with winning games than pleasing his players (as he should), but it is hard not to feel bad for Bale. As Thursday’s match against Villareal could be the title decider, it is unlikely that we will see Bale play unless Real Madrid have a multiple goal lead in the second half. Maybe he will appear against Leganes on Sunday, if Madrid do happen to win the title on Thursday. It would be unfair to Gareth not to have a proper sending-off from Real Madrid, as he probably will leave in the summer.

      <h10><b>4. Nearly Perfect Match From Courtois</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Thibaut Courtois has been Madrid’s unsung hero for much of this season. Today, he was no different, as he bagged the Man of the Match award. He made countless saves, including a brilliant double save in the dying minutes of the game to win Madrid the match. Courtois has absolutely earned La Liga’s Zamora trophy, given to the goalkeeper with the best goal-to-game ratio (20 goals conceded in 34 appearances). He also holds the most clean sheets in La Liga this season (18), one ahead of Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak.

      <h10><b>5. Villarreal Safely In Europa League</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Villarreal performed very well against Real Madrid, and definitely deserved at least a point from the game (they would have gotten it if not for Courtois’ amazing double save). They won’t be too broken up though, as they are now guaranteed a Europa League spot for next season. This will be a good test for a very talented team, led by great players like Gerrard Moreno and Santi Cazorla. If they make the right moves in this summer’s transfer window, they could have a serious shot at challenging for a top 4 spot in La Liga next year. I also feel that it would be a disservice not to mention Vicente Iborra’s wonderful headed goal late in the second half, a masterful flick towards the back post, and Courtois didn’t stand a chance.
