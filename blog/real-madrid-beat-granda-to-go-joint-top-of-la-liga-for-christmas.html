    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 2-0 Granada</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Goals from Casemiro and Karim Benzema were enough to lift Real Madrid over Granada and mask a poor performance from Los Blancos. Here are my five key takeaways from the match:

    <br></br>

            The match was almost turned on its head before 30 seconds had passed, as Rafael Varane was pressured in his own defensive 3rd, and panic-played his pass straight into the feet of his defender. The pass deflected and fell right to Granada striker Roberto Soldado, who was clean through on goal. Instead of shooting, he made the decision to square the ball to teammate Antonio Puertas, who had time and space in Madrid’s penalty area. He took on the shot first time and skied it 15 yards over the goal. However, Real Madrid wouldn’t learn from this early mistake, as they consistently had trouble playing out of the back (especially Varane, who looked panicked on the ball) through Granada’s high press.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Madrid were bailed out yet again in the 45th minute when Puertas (who had a very poor game from a finishing standpoint) got the ball inside Madrid’s 6-yard box from a Jesus Vallejo header. Puertas tripped over the ball, fumbling it, and allowed Madrid’s defenders to clear the ball from any danger. Had Granada’s players been a bit more clinical, this game would have gone much differently.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>2. More Injury Issues For Real Madrid</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Near the end of the first half, disaster struck for Real Madrid. Brazilian winger Rodrygo went down after a tackle from Dimitri Foulquier forced him off balance, seemingly injuring his hamstring. The 19-year-old was then stretchered off, and it seems that he will be out between 2-3 months. Rodrygo had just been hitting a good run of form, and this match was his second consecutive start in La Liga (his first set of consecutive starts so far this season). He is Madrid’s leading assister (joint-top with Karim Benzema on 5) in all competitions and has been a key player since Eden Hazard has been out injured. Real Madrid have struggled with injury issues this season, and now that Rodrygo is injured, every outfield player in Madrid’s squad has missed at least some game time this season due to injury issues.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>3. Casemiro Rescues Real Madrid Once Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With his header against Granada in the 57th minute, Casemiro is now on 3 goals in all competitions this season. Each of his goals have been critical to Madrid’s season, and all have secured points for Los Blancos (game-winner against Atletico Madrid, tying goal against Borussia Monchengladbach in their first UCL match, game-winner against Granada). While the Brazilian hasn’t had the best season in terms of putting up consistent performances, it’s inarguable that he has been clutch for Real Madrid in this campaign.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Can Asensio Be Real Madrid’s New Creative Outlet?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite being 35 years old, Luka Modric is still Real Madrid’s main source of creativity in the squad, and without him, they seem to have trouble creating chances. As he missed the Granada match due to an injury, I was prepared to see 90 minutes of Lucas Vazquez dumping in crosses to Benzema. Through the first 38 minutes, that vision was coming closer and closer to fruition. However once Marco Asensio came on for the injured Rodrygo, the match changed. Asensio began to create in ways that he hasn’t for quite some time (since before his ACL injury). Since he’d returned from his injury last season, he’d seemed a shadow of his former self (hence playing backup to Hazard, Rodryo, Vinicius Jr., and Lucas Vazquez). In the match against Granada, Asensio completed 2 dribbles, 3 key passes, and hit the post with a backheel volley. He also assisted Casemiro’s goal with a cross from a tight angle. Altogether, it was a good showing from the Spaniard, and he will have certainly impressed Zidane.

<!-- 5th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Granada Continue Their Poor Run Of Away Form</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Coming into this match, Granada had only won 2 of their 6 away matches this season (2-1-3). While their 3 losses are all acceptable, to Atletico Madrid, Real Sociedad, and Eduardo Coudet’s revived Celta Vigo, they’ve gone unbeaten at home, beating the likes of Sevilla, Granada, and Athletic Club. One has to question the reasoning for this; typically we could say that Granada play better when they’re backed by their fans, but with fans not being allowed in stadiums at the moment, there is no viable explanation for their inconsistent performances (or consistent performances, if you’re looking at home and away matches). They weren’t bested by Real Madrid on Wednesday night, it was their own mistakes and lack of finishing that let them down. This is a match that Granada should have won, and if they want to continue playing European football next season, they will have to sort out their consistency issues.
