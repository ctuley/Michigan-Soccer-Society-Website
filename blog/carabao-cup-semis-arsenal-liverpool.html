      <h12><b>Final Score: Arsenal 0 - 2 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Diogo Jota’s superb brace secured Liverpool a spot in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. After Arsenal’s determined performance in the first leg of the tie, they were overrun by Liverpool in the second after losing the midfield battle. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Arsenal Desperately Need A New Striker</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      This game against Liverpool highlighted how thin Arsenal’s bench is in attacking options. In the first half, Smith Rowe, Odegaard, Lacazette, Saka, and Martinelli all worked very hard, and this was evident in the second half. However, Arteta did not have many players to bring off the bench and this resulted in fewer touches in the central and higher regions of the pitch in the second half (shown by the diagram). Although Lacazette is arguably the best striker in Arsenal’s team, he missed many big chances that could have changed the course of the game; Arsenal need to sign a young quality striker that is able to take advantage of the chances created by the talents of Smith Rowe and Odegaard. The only thing that Arteta could do was bring on Nketiah, an inexperienced striker with minimal game time, on for Alexandre Lacazette.

      <h10><b>2. Arsenal need to strengthen their midfield</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The midfield was one of the many weak points in the game against Liverpool. With Fabinho, Curtis Jones, and Jordan Henderson bossing the midfield, it has been clear that we are nowhere near the level of the teams like Liverpool. With Partey getting sent off right after getting subbed on, Xhaka being suspended, and Elneny at the Africa Cup of Nations, Lokonga is our only senior midfielder available for the next game against Burnley, and Lokongo is quite inexperienced. Arsenal need to take advantage of the January transfer window to add some experience and quality in the midfield. In the past two games, two experienced midfielders have been sent off, a shocking stat. This clearly highlights the need to improve the discipline in the side and to avoid making dangerous and risky fouls. In possession, Liverpool were able to assemble into a 2-3-5 formation, taking a firm grasp on the midfield.

      <h10><b>3. Martinelli Is Starting To Show Promise</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Everybody loves a good redemption story, but it usually takes longer than two minutes for the main character to actually redeem themselves. Chris Wood was shown the perfect opportunity to score an equalizer for Burnley in the 93rd minute. Matej Vydra was able to draw Wolves defenders out and get a cross past Rui Patricio to where Wood was standing, unmarked, with an open net. Equalizers don’t come much easier than that. The player who has scored so many headed goals for Burnley over the last few seasons somehow couldn’t direct the header on target. But, when most players would have given up, Wood kept pushing for a goal. In the 95th minute, a cross was put into the box and Wood tried a bicycle kick for what surely would have been the goal of the season. But he didn’t make contact with the ball. Thankfully for him, Matt Doherty’s arm did, and a penalty was awarded. Wood stepped up to take, fired the ball into the top corner, and the redemption arc was completed.

      <h10><b>4. Liverpool Solid Without Salah Or Mane</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With Salah and Mane at the Africa Cup of Nations, arguably the two best players in the team, many thought that Liverpool would be a weaker side. However, a couple of players stood up for them on the day. Namely, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota. The link-up between those two players is what brought about the second goal and their ability to create chances out of nothing made Liverpool a dangerous threat. Jota had 2 shots on target and 2 goals, highlighting this player’s efficiency and deadliness on the pitch.

      <h10><b>5. Top 4 Is A Must For Arsenal</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With Arsenal out of the Carabao cup, Arteta’s team needs to reach top 4 to be able to call this season a successful one. With no European football and no other cup competitions, Arsenal only have the Premier League to focus on. There are no excuses. Not only will top 4 be useful in boosting the legacy of Arsenal and the pride of the fans, but Champions League football will attract some of the best players around the world, and Arsenal might finally be able to bring in quality players to fill in the gaps in the team (such as a striker and midfielder).
