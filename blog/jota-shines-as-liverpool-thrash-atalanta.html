      <h12><b>Final Score: Atalanta 0-5 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        High scoring offenses clashed on Tuesday as Bergamo played host to a lively Champions League fixture. Liverpool took a two-goal lead into the half and extended it to five by the 54th minute. Despite plenty of good chances, Duvan Zapata and Atalanta’s offense found themselves unable to net a single goal while their backline was overrun by the pace and skill of Liverpool’s front three. Here are five key takeaways from this match:

      <h10><b>1. Liverpool’s New Striker?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Following their nearly 50 million dollar signing of Diogo Jota over the summer, many questions were raised as to where he would fit into the team. Having previously filled in on the wing and in the midfield, head coach Jurgen Klopp chose to start the young Portuguese international at striker for their fixture against Atalanta. Weaving his way between defenders, Jota found the back of the net three times his 65 minutes on the pitch. While this is obviously great news for the player and the club as a whole, it might mean a spot on the bench for their previous number nine Roberto Firmino. Under fire for his lack of goals in all competitions, Firmino has been on the hot seat for the past couple of years. While it is still too early to say that Jota will become Liverpool’s new starting striker, he will most definitely be competing for Firmino’s spot.

      <h10><b>2. The Invisible Papu Gomez</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Captain and star of Atalanta’s world-class attack, Papu Gomez was a name rarely mentioned during the match yesterday. The Argentine attacking midfielder found himself unable to produce much going forward and was hardly involved in the game as a whole. With eight-goal contributions in nine matches this season, Liverpool’s midfield managed to stifle his productivity, harming Atalanta’s attack. Combine that with the Italian side being on the back foot all match and you can understand how Liverpool ran away with the game. With the reverse fixture at Anfield being less than a month away, head coach Gian Piero Gasperini will need to find a way to get his captain more involved if they want to break down Liverpool’s backline.

      <h10><b>3. Another Clean Sheet Without Van Dijk</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Following his season-ending ACL injury, there were many questions as to how Liverpool would cope without the presence of star center back Virgil Van Dijk. Compounding this issue was the loss of fellow center back Joel Matip and defensive midfielder Fabinho, both of which have had injury struggles themselves. With all these players unable to make the squad, Klopp was left with 19-year-old Rhys Williams to slot alongside Joe Gomez to face a relentless Atalanta attack. Despite his lack of experience, Williams showed a lot of promise during the match as he consistently connected passes and cleared away dangerous balls. Their 5-0 win yesterday marks the team’s third clean sheet in their three Champions League matches, all played without Van Dijk. While the Dutchman’s presence will always be missed, Jurgen Klopp will be very happy with how his players have stepped up to fill that hole.

      <h10><b>4. Atalanta’s Defense Left Wide Open</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Whereas Liverpool held down the fort well in defense, the story was quite different for Atalanta. Right from the start of the match, holes were apparent between their defenders. Their defensive set up provides three center backs with two wing-backs who tend to go very high up the pitch, leaving their back three on their own very often. Thanks to some fantastic early saves by Marco Sportiello, Atalanta was able to mitigate the damage in the first half. However, Liverpool’s pace up front proved too much for them to handle, with players breaking free for counter-attacks and slipping in between defenders all too often. While the five defender set up is one that many Italian sides prefer, most notably by Napoli and Inter, Gasperini will need to figure out a new set up if his team hopes to gain any points from the reverse fixture later this month.

      <h10><b>5. Italian Side Still Very Much in Competition for Knockout Stage</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While a 5-0 defeat is always disheartening, Atalanta are still in full control of their destiny. Sitting even on points with Ajax but behind on goal differential, their final three matches of the group stage will be vital if they hope to advance in the competition. Liverpool needs just one win or two draws to guarantee their spot in the next round, however, the second opening is anyone’s game. With three weeks until their next Champions League match, Atalanta will look to sharpen up their defense and ramp back up their attack in order to take some points from their final matches. Football fans should be in for a treat, as Ajax and Atalanta are set to meet on the final matchday in what could potentially be a winner-take-all matchup. No matter what happens in the group, it is sure to be a fun ride following this Atalanta team.
