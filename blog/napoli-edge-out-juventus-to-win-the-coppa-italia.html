    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After 90 minutes of sharp defense and world-class goalkeeping, the Coppa Italia was decided by penalty kicks. A key save from 23-year-old Alex Meret of Napoli and a shocking miss from Juventus’s Danilo secured the win for the club from Naples. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Napoli’s Season Could Still Have Life</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Being 24 points away from first place Juventus in the Serie A and uncertain about the return of the Champion’s League, things had been looking rather bleak for Napoli. Bringing home the Coppa Italia is a huge step forward for Gennaro Gattuso’s club, as they look forward to finishing the season strong in hopes to play European football next year. After many early struggles for the club, things are starting to fall into place just in time for football to resume. With the Champions League resuming in August, Napoli could be poised to pull off an upset at Barcelona’s Camp Nou, following a 1-1 draw in their first meeting.

            After a fast start to the match, Juventus seemed to slow down a bit and showed weaknesses in their play. Maybe they still need to shake some rust off, but from what they showed against Napoli in this Final there seem to be areas of their defense that can be exploited. Maurizio Sarri’s high backline was caught out at times and seemed slow to react on set pieces. If it weren’t for a phenomenal double save from Gianluigi Buffon, there would have been no need for a penalty shootout. With Lazio just a point behind and Inter lurking close, Juventus could find themselves in trouble if they are unable to right the ship.

          <h10><b>3. Backup Keeper Alex Meret Shines in Rare Start</b></h10>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Following a booking in Napoli’s semifinal match against Inter Milan, goalkeeper David Ospina was restricted from playing against Juventus. Ospina put on a remarkable performance in the semifinal, contributing a plethora of saves and a key pass to secure their 1-0 victory. However, due to his bookings, Alex Meret was slotted between the sticks and immediately tested by an early shot from Ronaldo. Throughout the match, Meret made vital saves and clearances in order to keep Juventus’s relentless attack at bay. His save of Dybala’s penalty kick in the shootout proved his ability and helped secure the trophy for his club.

    <h10><b>4. Juventus Shows Variety of Shapes on the Pitch While Napoli Defends Impeccably</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With each team now allotted five substitutions, managers have an opportunity to make significant changes to their in-game tactics. While only using three of their five substitutes, Maurizio Sarri showed just how versatile his team was, and displayed a rather unpredictable squad. From the start of the game, his front three were interchangeable in their positions, having Ronaldo drift wide at times and Costa completely switching sides of the pitch. His substitutions such as Danilo for Costa showed his ability to move players around, making it tougher for Gattuso’s side to defend. Nonetheless, even all of Sarri’s changes could not break Napoli’s world-class backline. Central defender Kalidou Koulibaly shined alongside the likes of Mario Rui and Nikola Maksimovic as they stood their ground against relentless attacks from Juventus. Come August in their matchup against Barcelona, Leo Messi and company will have their work cut out for them trying to score against this Napoli side.

    <h10><b>5. Ronaldo Loses Second Consecutive Club Final for First Time in Career</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Following a defeat against Lazio in the Italian Super Cup in December, the Coppa Italia marks the second consecutive final Ronaldo has lost with his club, a first in his career. With an extensive trophy collection from his league titles across three leagues and numerous European Cups, this is a rare occasion for Ronaldo to be on the losing end again. If Juventus were to falter and lose the Serie A this season, it could call into question the 35-year-old’s talent and whether or not it is time for another transfer. With rumors that Ronaldo wants to play in the MLS near the end of his career, it seems as though this could be one of his last few seasons in Europe. It is a rather bold assumption with how much talent Ronaldo has shown even at his age, and only time will tell where he will end up.
