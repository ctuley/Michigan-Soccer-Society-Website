      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 3 - 0 Sheffield United</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 victory over Sheffield United at Old Trafford on Wednesday thanks to a hat trick from Anthony Martial, and Paul Pogba was terrific in his first start since September. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Are Manchester United Good Again?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        For the first time all season, Manchester United seemed to have put out their best XI. With the likes of Pogba, Bruno, Rashford, and Martial, this may be the most talented Manchester United team since Ferguson left. They’ve been pretty inconsistent so far this season, and they’ve really struggled to break down teams that like to sit deep as Sheffield did today. Having guys like Bruno and Pogba in the midfield seem to be the answer to that problem. Both are very good at dropping deep and breaking the low block either through a pass, dribble, or long shot. Pogba’s cameo against Tottenham was a preview of what was to come today as United looked so much more dangerous with him pulling the strings from deep. They completely dominated the game - the xG was 2.84-0.11 in United’s favor (understat.com) - and with this level of talent and a relatively easy schedule ahead, they are a genuine threat for third or fourth place.

      <h10><b>2. Depleted Sheffield United are Completely Outmatched</b></h10>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Without two key defenders and star goalkeeper Dean Henderson, this was always going to be a tough one for Sheffield United. The Blades have been punching above their weight all season, but their lack of quality depth has caused them problems since the restart. Sheffield looked better going forward than they have the last couple of games - working the ball wide and trying to create overloads - but their crossing was off, either being blocked or failing to find a target in the box. On the defensive side, Manchester United carved them up. They constantly put pressure on the Sheffield United defense when in possession, and the Blades struggled to get forward without being susceptible to Manchester United’s deadly counterattack. Before the restart, a Champions League spot was still a realistic possibility for Sheffield United, but now they’ll have to work extremely hard to even finish in the Europa League spots.

      <h10><b>3. Anthony Martial: Hat Trick Hero</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Surprisingly, this was Manchester United’s first Premier League hat-trick since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013. Anthony Martial put in a man of the match performance against Sheffield United, showing off some excellent finishing on his three goals. He nearly added an assist in the first half when he spearheaded a counterattack that found him one-on-one with the goalkeeper before laying the ball off to Marcus Rashford. Rashford, unfortunately, could not direct the shot on target. He hasn’t been able to fill the striker role since his first season under Louis van Gaal - with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Romelu Lukaku taking that spot recently - but he’s been excellent in it this season while forming a deadly partnership with Marcus Rashford. With Bruno and Pogba behind them, United’s attack is looking deadly for the foreseeable future.

      <h10><b>4. Pogba Once Again Showing His Worth</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        He had been out for so long, I almost forgot how great Paul Pogba can be. Against Tottenham, we saw a player that brought that extra bit of quality required to break down Mourinho’s deep block - drawing the equalizing penalty and causing all sorts of trouble. On Wednesday against Sheffield United, the result was no different. Pogba’s playmaking ability from deep was able to break through the low block that Manchester United have struggled with all season long. Though he didn’t come out with a goal or assist, Pogba did have four key passes and 0.33 expected assists (understat.com) - both very good for a deeper-lying midfielder. He was also crucial to Manchester United’s buildup play - having the fourth highest xGBuildup on the team. Along with Bruno, Pogba will be critical in any success United have the rest of this season.

      <h10><b>5. Bruno Fernandes Shows He can Affect the Game in Other Ways</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Speaking of Bruno, he had a bit of a quiet game as far as the final ball is concerned. Just two shots and one key pass - with an xG of 0.08 and an xA of 0.03 - is not what we’ve come accustomed to seeing from the Portuguese midfielder. That said, he still had a good game overall. He was heavily involved in buildup play - with the third-highest xGBuildup on the team - and though he didn’t play the final ball, he was crucial in two of the three goals in the match. It was the first game since his debut where he didn’t score or assist, but in this game, Bruno showed how he can affect the game without being the one taking the shot or playing the final pass.
