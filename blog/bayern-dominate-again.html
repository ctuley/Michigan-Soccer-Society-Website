    <h12><b>Final Score: Bayer 04 Leverkusen 2 - 4 Bayern Münich</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>Bayern Munich traveled to Bayer Leverkusen this Saturday, and despite being in a losing position for the first time since December, Bayern ultimately took control and won the game 4-2. Here are five key takeaways:</h13>

    <h10><b>1. Bayern are Unstoppable</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      If the Champions League somehow returns, Bayern Munich would absolutely be the favorites to win the whole thing. Before today, they hadn’t been in a losing position during a match since the Werder Bremen match in December, and they haven’t been beaten on expected goals since the November match against Frankfurt (fbref.com). They are healthy, they have great depth, they create a lot of chances, and they suffocate their opponents. I don’t see anyone stopping them in the Bundesliga, and I couldn’t see anyone stopping them in Europe either.

    <h10><b>2. Leverkusen Struggle to Create Without Havertz</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It’s always a struggle to create good chances against Bayern anyway, but without their biggest creative and goalscoring threat, Leverkusen never stood a chance. Kai Havertz was out of the game with a muscle injury he picked up last weekend. In his place was Lucas Alario - who to his credit got on the scoresheet. Unfortunately, after that first goal, Leverkusen struggled to create much of anything and failed to keep Bayern at bay. The expected goals at the end of the match ended 2.6-1.0 in favor of Bayern (fbref.com). Alario did fine as a replacement striker, but he failed to create anything for his teammates - something that Havertz has done so well when in that role. 0 shot-creating actions, 0 key passes, only 13 completed passes, Alario failed to get his teammates involved, and that no doubt contributed to Leverkusen’s struggles.

    <h10><b>3. Thomas Müller: Record Breaker</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <div class="row-articles">
      <div class="column-articles">
        <div class="card-articles">
          <h13>
            Just as Kevin De Bruyne himself might break the Premier League assist record,Thomas Müller has tied De Bruyne’s Bundesliga assist record. The 30-year-old attacking midfielder has had an incredible season so far, with 7 goals and 20 assists to his name. The amazing thing is that he’s reached the 20 assist mark in about 1000 fewer minutes than De Bruyne did. His expected assists of 11.4 this season suggest he’s been a bit lucky, but when you’re creating chances for players like Robert Lewandowski, your chances are bound to become goals more often than expected. The other amazing thing is that Müller isn’t on set pieces either. Players like De Bruyne can sometimes boost their assist and expected assist numbers by creating chances through set pieces, but Müller creates almost all of his chances via open play. He’s never been particularly flashy, but Thomas Müller has always been able to get the job done.

    <h10><b>4. Leon Bailey: Maybe Not The Future Of CONCACAF</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      When he burst onto the scene a couple of years ago, people expected Leon Bailey to be one of the future stars of CONCACAF. Sure, there were still issues with actually getting him to play for Jamaica, but that would be solved in good time. Some expected him to propel Jamaica into the 2nd tier in North America, right behind Mexico and the USA. Since then, Bailey has been less than stellar. Though his expected production has remained fairly similar on a per 90 basis, he has been getting way fewer minutes than the previous two seasons. Even in this match, he was subbed off at halftime after creating absolutely nothing. He also hasn’t done too much for Jamaica, making only four appearances total for his country so far. There are interesting parallels with Bayern’s Alphonso Davies. The Canadian star has been hyped by some as potentially the best left-back in the world and has people convinced he can put Canada in that tier just behind Mexico and the USA. Only time will tell, but Davies is at the very least guaranteed to play in a World Cup when Canada joint-hosts the 2026 tournament. With the World Cup expanding to 48 teams, perhaps Bailey and Jamaica can join them.

    <h10><b>5. David Alaba: The Unsung Hero Of Bayern’s Defense</b></h10>

    <br></br>
    <h13>

      <div class="row-articles">
        <div class="column-articles">
          <div class="card-articles">
            <h13>Hero might be a bit strong of a word - he isn’t exactly propelling them to the title or saving them from relegation - but David Alaba has been absolutely fantastic this season. Alphonso Davies has been receiving most of the plaudits this season, but Alaba has quietly been their best defensive player despite moving to center back from his favored left back position. He’s, unsurprisingly, been very comfortable in possession, progressing the ball very well through his passing (8.80 progressive passes per 90 - joint second-best on the team) and his carrying (progressing 277.6 yards towards goal per 90 - the best on the team). He’s also producing 1.53 shot-creating actions per 90, including two in the match against Leverkusen. He’s also solid defensively, although not very aggressive, with just over two interceptions and one tackle won per 90 when adjusted for possession. His defensive attributes, however, aren’t anywhere close to being as important as his quality in possession, and that’s where people need to really take notice of him at center back. He’s stepped into a role he’s not as comfortable in and completely knocked it out of the park. Perhaps leaving him in that position will change Bayern’s recruitment strategy going forward.
