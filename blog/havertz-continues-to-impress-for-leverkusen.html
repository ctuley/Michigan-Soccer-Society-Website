    <h12><b>Final Score: Bayer Leverkusen 3 - 1 Borussia Mönchengladbach</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In Match Week 27, Bayer Leverkusen defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach 3-1 to move into third place, and a Champions League position. Despite a second-half surge from Gladbach, Leverkusen led for most of the match thanks to a brace from rising star Kai Havertz and a header from Sven Bender. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Demirbay was Leverkusen’s Most Influential Midfielder</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Although Havertz may receive most of the plaudits in Leverkusen’s vital win, Kerim Demirbay was the best representation of his team’s performance throughout the match. In the opening minutes, the German international controlled the pace of the match with precise passing and dribbling, and used an interception to spring winger Karim Bellarabi who fed Havertz for the game’s opening goal. Following the goal, Demirbay continued to use cutting passes to set up chances, and should have scored himself just before half-time after Havertz hit the post, but hesitated and had his shot blocked on the goal line. After the break, Demirbay appeared to lose his confidence and in turn, his influence on the game, which allowed Galdbach to control possession and score the tying goal. However, he recovered, and sealed the game with a teasing cross converted by Bender, and calmly took care of the ball until the final whistle. When Leverkusen were at their best, Demirbay was at the center of it.

            Known as one of the Bundesliga’s top shot-stoppers, Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer also exhibited his strong passing skills against Leverkusen. Gladbach’s defenders consistentlydeferred to Sommer to break Leverkusen’s press, and Sommer responded with a series of calm passes both on the ground and in the air. Additionally, Gladbach’s only goal was started by a pinpoint long ball from Sommer to Marcus Thurman. While Sommer was left with little chance to prevent Leverkusen’s three goals, he still stood out as one of their key performers.

    <h10><b>3. Gladbach have Found a Star in Marcus Thuram</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Deployed primarily as a left-winger/left forward, Thuram used his strength and dribbling to exhibit strong hold-up play, and act as Gladbach’s primary attacking outlet. Thuram grew into the game and shined in the second half. Shortly after the break, Thuram carried out a slaloming solo move and almost set up Plea with a deft pass into the box. In the 52nd minute, Thuram tied the game with a searing half-volley inside the box, and almost scored again on a breakaway just minutes later. Although fatigue forced him to exit the game in the 78th minute, Thuram was Gladbach’s most dangerous player when he was on the pitch, and almost single-handedly kept them in the game.

            With Kevin Volland out due to injury, Havertz played as Leverkusen’s central striker. Typically used as a free-roaming attacking midfielder, Havertz used his new position to move across the attacking third and even dropped into the midfield in order to bring his teammates into the game. Despite a thin frame, Havertz overwhelmed the Gladbach defense by finding pockets of space and exploiting them with his elegant dribbling and passing. Exemplified by his adept finish at close range to open the scoring, Havertz brought the extra little bit of quality to Leverkusen that ultimately separated them in the match.
