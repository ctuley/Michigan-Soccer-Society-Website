      <h12><b>Final Score: Arsenal 0-1 Burnley</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both Arsenal and Burnley came into the game in dire need of a win. The game was also set to be a battle of differing philosophies as Sean Dyche’s tough, defensive setup would be pitted against Mikel Arteta’s (theoretically) more free-flowing attacking strategy. It ended up being quite fitting that the only goal of this match between two teams with scoring troubles was an own goal that lifted Burnley out of the relegation zone. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Arsenal Played Right Into Burnley’s Hands</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Without a clear playmaker through the middle of the field - the number 10 role was filled by striker Alexandre Lacazette - Arsenal was forced to do what they have been criticized for doing in recent matches: they played A LOT of crosses. After putting in 34 crosses against Tottenham last weekend, Arsenal played 38 against Burnley. This is exactly what Burnley wanted Arsenal to do. Burnley’s whole defensive structure is designed to clog up the middle, force play wide, and use their aerial prowess to clear any danger the might come from crosses into the box. Add to that the fact that Arsenal do not have a striker who can consistently win aerial duels (my how they must long for Olivier Giroud), and Arsenal’s attacking strategy was pretty useless today. They created a couple of good chances, Nick Pope dealt with anything that got through Burnley’s defense in an excellent showing from the goalkeeper.

      <h10><b>2. Xhaka’s Red Card Completely Changes The Game</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Though he was not directly involved in any chance creation, Granit Xhaka was key to Arsenal’s buildup today. Most moves went through him, and his long passing allowed him to switch play and spray balls out wide to the fullbacks pushing up to assist the offense. So when Xhaka decided to get himself sent off by putting his hand on the neck of Ashley Westwood after making a tackle that already got him a yellow card, not only did it force Arsenal to play a man down for the last half hour but it completely killed any offensive momentum Arsenal had built up to start the second half. Without Xhaka, Arsenal’s buildup play looked totally disjointed and those effects were felt further forward as they failed to create a high percentage chance the rest of the match.

      <h10><b>3. Aubameyang’s Scoring Drought Ends In The Worst Possible Way</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        You have to feel bad for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He finally scored his first goal for Arsenal since November 1st, but unfortunately, it was for the other team. Aubameyang’s form has been hurt the most by Arsenal not having a good playmaker as he’s struggled for chances - scoring one non-penalty goal from an xG of 1.8 in the league this season. Even shifting from the left-side to a more familiar central role hasn’t been able to get him back to the goalscoring heights of the last two seasons. It is frustrating to see a great player struggle like this, especially when you know it really isn’t his fault. Arsenal need to make a move for a creative attacking midfielder in January because their captain isn’t going to get back to his best until they do.

      <h10><b>4. Burnley Starting To Get Back On Track</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        You can never count Burnley out. After picking up just two points from their first seven games, Sean Dyche’s team have now picked up seven from their last four. Key players are starting to come back from injury and the defense has improved as a result. They will still struggle to create goals as they have in seasons past, but if the defense can keep games tight, results will start to go their way as Dyche’s team is built to win one score games. New players should be brought in in January to both improve the first team and add depth in case of another injury crisis, but the on-field product is starting to get back to what we’re used to seeing from Burnley.

      <h10><b>5. The Arteta Situation</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        What do you do with Mikel Arteta? I don’t think anyone could argue that the results in Arteta’s first full season thus far have been acceptable. They sit 15th in the table on just 13 points. Arteta has implemented a clear philosophy - something Arsenal fans had been wanting throughout the Unai Emery era - but the philosophy just does not seem to suit the players at the club. You could cut him some slack and give him a couple of years to get players in that suit his system, but with results going the way they are it makes it unlikely that Arsenal will be able to afford the talent they need or attract players to the club without European competition. So do you cut him loose? If so, who do you bring in? There is no way Pochettino takes that job, and there really isn’t anyone available that is both a suitable long term option and will get more out of this squad than Arteta. It’s a tough situation with no clear answer, and it’ll be interesting to see what Arsenal decide to do.
