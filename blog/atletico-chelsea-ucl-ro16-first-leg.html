      <h12><b>Final Score: Atletico Madrid 0-1 Chelsea</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Due to CBS’s genius marketing plan of putting the high-scoring game behind a paywall, American viewers were forced to watch this tight, scrappy affair between two of the world’s best tacticians: Thomas Tuchel and Diego Simeone. In the end, Olivier Giroud’s excellent bicycle kick gave Chelsea the advantage going into the second leg. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Chelsea Play Pandemic Ball To Near Perfection</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If you have kept an eye on Chelsea in the league since Tuchel was brought in, this lineup and system should be no surprise to see. In order to tighten up the defense, and make the best use of the pieces at his disposal, Thomas Tuchel has his team using the possession-as-defense tactic that we’ve seen Guardiola’s Manchester City use in recent weeks. It has worked so far, and not only has the defense been in fine form in recent games, players that were on the fringes like Jorginho and Christensen have become key pieces again. Their setup suffocated a deep-sitting Atletico Madrid (just as it did Jose Mourinho’s Spurs team a couple of weeks ago), and they never really felt in danger of giving up a goal. The style is perfect for pandemic-ball when defenses are not pressing as much and teams can keep possession easier, and Chelsea played it to near perfection. I say near perfection because they still struggled a bit to create chances. Manchester City have fixed the issue by stuffing a ton of creative passers into their team, but Chelsea do not have the personnel to make that work. They will need to get the likes of Hudson-Odoi, Ziyech, and Havertz going if they want this system to work at its full potential.

      <h10><b>2. Atletico’s Makeshift Backline Puts In Solid Shift</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Atletico Madrid’s defense has had a dip in form lately as they have dealt with a myriad of injuries, but the makeshift back four performed admirably against Chelsea. Yes, they conceded the one goal, but they kept Chelsea out of dangerous areas for most of the game, and Chelsea’s attackers struggled to try and solve the puzzle that Atletico’s defense created. The defenders were helped out by the wide midfielders helping out and dropping back to deal with Chelsea’s wingbacks, but they put in really nice performances in their own rights. With the number of key injuries they are dealing with on defense, Atletico Madrid should be very happy with both the performance and the position it puts them in going into the second leg.

      <h10><b>3. What Can Atletico Do To Get The Offense Going?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Like the defense when it was hit with injuries, Atletico Madrid’s offense has regressed in recent weeks, albeit for different reasons. Atletico was vastly overperforming their expected goals at the beginning of the season, and given that their style of play means they do not create a ton of chances to begin with, that overperformance was key to them dominating games. So what can Atletico do to get their offense going in the second leg? They will need to switch up the style of play. Admittedly, the injuries to the defense hurt what they can do offensively, but their midfield and forward personnel should suit a more possession dominating approach should they decide to play that way. On top of that, this Chelsea defense usually struggles when playing on the back foot. If Atletico can sustain possession and put pressure on the Chelsea defense, they should be able to overcome the deficit in the second leg.

      <h10><b>4. How Will Chelsea Cope Without Mount?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a season where players either will not or are unable to press a whole lot during games, Mason Mount has been a key piece in games where Chelsea are not dominating games. He is the 12th most active presser in the Premier League this season, and that defensive work rate means he can still be a valuable player even if he is not creating much offensively. Unfortunately for Chelsea, an early yellow card for Mount means he will miss the second leg through suspension. How they will cope without him will really be based on how Tuchel wants to attack the second leg. If he wants to dominate the games like he did today, expect to see Ziyech or Havertz come in or Hudson-Odoi push up from wingback. If Tuchel thinks Atletico Madrid are going to take a more possession-focused approach and he wants to play on the counter more and defend the lead, expect to see Christian Pulisic come in and cause chaos in a potentially stretched Atletico backline. Tuchel has plenty of options off the bench that should do a good job in place of Mount, but who we will see will depend on how Tuchel wants to approach the game.

      <h10><b>5. Don’t Expect Fireworks In The Second Leg Either</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If I were to guess, I would say the second leg will probably look a lot like this game. Given that the difference is just the one goal, I do not think Atletico will change their approach too much as they still created a couple of nice chances throughout the game that they just couldn’t take advantage of. On top of that, with a one-goal lead, Tuchel will probably be even more conservative and try to suffocate Atletico through dominating possession play again. It should be another interesting tactical battle, but do not expect fireworks like the second leg of Atletico-Liverpool last season.
