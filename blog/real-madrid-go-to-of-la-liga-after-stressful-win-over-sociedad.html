    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Sociedad 1 - 2 Real Madrid</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Real Madrid beat Real Sociedad in an intense end-to-end match that took them to the top of the La Liga table.

    <h10><b>1. Zidane Starts James Rodriguez; Backfires on Him</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In Real Madrid’s win over Valencia on Thursday night, Zidane deployed Eden Hazard and Fede Valverde on the wings of his favored 4-3-3, and it worked quite well. Hazard was free to move from wing to wing, and Fede could drop into the midfield as he pleased, and it worked very well against a top Valencia side. Instead of carrying his team’s momentum by utilizing the same starting lineup on Sunday night, he replaced Hazard with Vinicius Jr. and Fede with James Rodriguez (Fede actually moved down into midfield for the match and Modric was pushed out of the lineup). While Vinicius has been performing well lately off the bench, James had not appeared since before the restart. In Sunday’s match, Vinicius played very well, drawing Real Madrid’s penalty in the 49th minute, and was a candidate for man of the match. Rodriguez, however, was woeful in the 78 minutes that he played. He made no impact on the game, and Zidane will not be keen to start James again anytime soon.

            Sergio Ramos broke another record in last night’s match. The Madrid captain is now La Liga’s top goal-scoring defender of all time, surpassing Barcelona’s Ronald Koeman, who scored 67 goals from the center back position in his spell with the Blaugranes. This is just another way that Ramos is cementing himself into Spanish football history after he broke Iker Casillas’ record of appearances (167) for the Spanish National Team last summer with 170 caps.

          <h10><b>3. Mikel Merino Puts in a Fantastic Performance</b></h10>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Sociedad’s young midfielder had a great match on Sunday night. Merino, who plays as part deep-lying playmaker, part secondary holding midfielder, was the origin of most of Sociedad’s attack. He won the ball in midfield many times, putting in a class defensive performance, and would quickly move the ball to Sociedad’s front four. The young Spaniard even bagged himself a goal in the 83rd minute, settling Roberto Lopez’ cross and hammering the ball over an outstretched Courtois, rounding out a great performance.

    <h10><b>4. Favorous Decisions Win Madrid the Match</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      There were three goal deciding decisions in this match, and all of them went in favor of Los Blancos. The first was a penalty drawn by Vinicius Jr., whose heel was barely clipped by Sociedad center back Diego Llorente. VAR reviewed the call, and decided that the call did stand, and Sergio Ramos converted the penalty.
      The next decision that went in Madrid’s favor came at the other end of the field. In the 68th minute, substitute Adnan Januzaj hit a shot from the outside of the box, and it snuck past Courtois. However, one of Januzaj’s teammates was in the path of the ball, blocking Courtois’ vision. The Sociedad player, Mikel Merino, happened to be in an offside position, and the goal was not given. It is debatable if Merino really obstructed Courtois’ vision, but that doesn’t matter at the present.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Finally, two minutes later, Karim Benzema scored at the other end. The controversy in this goal comes in how Benzema settled the ball to line up his shot: with his shoulder. VAR reviewed it to see if it was a handball and confirmed that it was not. These three minutes gave two controversial decisions that put Real Madrid up two goals when Real Sociedad realistically could have been up by one.

    <h10><b>5. Real Madrid are La Liga Toppers, Now Favorites to Win</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Due to Barcelona’s draw with Sevilla on Friday, Real Madrid’s win on Sunday night put them on top of La Liga due to their superior head-to-head record over Barcelona. As Madrid have an easier schedule to end the season, they will be the favorites to win the 2019-2020 La Liga title. They must do their best not to slip up, as Barcelona will surely capitalize on any mistakes Los Blancos make. At this time, La Liga is Real Madrid’s for the taking, and they made a step today towards their 34th league title.
