    <h13>
      To put it lightly, the 2019-2020 season has not been Barcelona’s best. They finished second in La Liga to their rivals Real Madrid, were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey by Athletic Club, and lost to Atletico Madrid in the first round of the Spanish Supercup. If they don’t win the Champions League, they will have their first trophy-less season since the 2013-2014 campaign.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      If they want to move on to the quarter-finals, they will have to beat a tough Napoli side at the Camp Nou. In the reverse fixture back in February, the teams drew 1-1, with Barcelona grabbing an important away goal. It may be a blessing in disguise that Barcelona didn’t beat Napoli in February, as they have had a habit in the past few years of winning big in the first leg of Champions League matches, and going into the second leg with a lack of focus and intensity and blowing it (Roma in 2018, Liverpool in 2019).
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <div class="row-articles">

        <div class="card-articles">
          <h13>
            This will be a tough matchup, as Napoli are a team of warriors. Even though they had a very poor domestic campaign (finishing 7th in the Serie A), manager Gennaro Gattuso will have his boys ready for this matchup. He knows that this is a Barcelona team not playing at its best, and that they have many weaknesses that he can exploit. Napoli will most likely come out flying, trying to catch Barcelona out quickly by grabbing an away goal. Barcelona will have to be very cautious with how they play this match, as any mistakes can lead to giving up precious away goals. I assume Barcelona will try to hold possession for as much of the match as possible, forcing Napoli to press and wear themselves out, making use of their current away-goal advantage.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Barcelona’s key to winning this game will be to keep control of the match, to keep Napoli on the back foot. If they hold the ball for long enough, Napoli will become desperate, which will make them more aggressive. As they become more aggressive, less energy will be put into intelligent defending and pressing, and Napoli will become frantic, and they will begin to make mistakes. Knowing Barcelona’s finishers, they will certainly punish Napoli for all of the mistakes that they make, which will be how they win the match.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>How Will They Line Up:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Barcelona’s lineup is not hard to predict, as they have so few options due to injuries and suspensions. In goal, Setien wouldn’t dream of playing anyone other than Marc-Andre ter Stegen, as he has been one of Barcelona’s best players this season. Barcelona only have 5 players available for selection in defense: Nelson Semedo, Gerard Pique, Clement Lenglet, Jordi Alba, and Junior Firpo. Samuel Umtiti is out with a knee issue. This defense will have to be at their very best, as Napoli’s forwards (Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens, Arkadiusz Milik, Jose Callejon, Hirving Lozano) are the strongest part of their team.
    </h13>
    <br></br>

          <h13>
            In the midfield, Barcelona have even fewer options. Arthur, who was recently forced into a move to Juventus, is refusing to play in Barcelona’s Champions League campaign, and Sergio Busquets is out via suspension. This means that Barcelona’s midfield 3 will be made up of Frenkie de Jong, Ivan Rakatic, and Sergi Roberto. While this midfield 3 is certainly talented, it could certainly be overrun by Napoli’s midfielders. While de Jong has had a fine first season at Barcelona, Rakitic and Roberto have had poor seasons by their standards, and will be looking to prove that they should not be sold in the current transfer window.
          </h13>

          <br></br>

          <h13>
            In attack, it is unknown if Ousmane Dembele will play, as he is still regaining fitness after a hamstring injury. This leaves Antione Griezmann, Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi, and Ansu Fati available for Setien. I expect the first three to start, and we will see Fati come off of the bench early in the second half to bring an “X factor” to Barcelona’s attack.

          </h13>

          <br></br>

          <h13>
            It will be interesting to see how Setien fills out the bench for this match, as he has so few players available. I assume we will see an abundance of youth team players on the bench, and a few may even see some playing time if Barcelona runs riot in the match.

          </h13>

    <h10><b>Player To Watch:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Lionel Messi (Age: 33, Position: Forward)</b><h12>
      <br></br>
    <h13>
      Who else? The best player in the world had another great season, racking up 30 goals and 26 assists in all competitions. He has carried an underperforming Barcelona team on his back this season, and without him they might not even have secured Champions League football. Messi will have to be at his best again for the Napoli match, as I don’t believe Barcelona can scrape by just on their away goal. Messi will need to help his team score, or do all of the work himself, as he has done on many occasions this season.
    </h13>
    <img src="../blog-img/champions-league-team-preview-fc-barcelona/champions-league-team-preview-fc-barcelona-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>Prediction: Quarterfinals</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I think Barcelona will beat Napoli (2-1 is my prediction), and they will make it to the quarterfinals. There they will most likely face a high-flying Bayern Munich side, who, at this time, are playing the best soccer in the world. I expect Barcelona to put up a good fight, but they will be no match for the Bavarians. They will lose (probably by quite a few goals), and will finish the season trophyless.
    </h13>
