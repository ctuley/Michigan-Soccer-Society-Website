      <h10>Granada Topple a Lackluster Athletic Club Side On La Liga Opening Weekend</h10>

      <h12><b>Final Score: Granada 2-0 Athletic Club</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In what was supposed to be La Liga’s opening match (it was pushed back by a day due to scheduling disagreements between the La Liga and the Spanish FA), Granada beat a very unenthusiastic Athletic Bilbao courtesy of goals from Yanglel Herrera and Luis Milla. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Granada Pick Up From Where They Left Off</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Granada’s last match of the 2019/20 season was against none other than Athletic Club, who they thrashed 4-0 to secure a Europa League spot. Yesterday they proved that they are still flying high, and ready to pick up where they left off. While they didn’t have the lion’s share of possession or create more chances than Athletic, they were clinical when it mattered, and they left Los Carmenes with a deserved 3 points.

      <h10><b>2. It Took 139 minutes To Get Our First La Liga 2020/21 Goal</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Saturday morning brought us the (unexpected) La Liga opener between Eibar and Celta Vigo, which proved to be a fairly end-to-end match between two teams that had no finishing abilities. The match ended goalless and we had to wait until the second half of the Granada-Athletic Club match for the 2020/21 season’s first goal when Yangel Herrera headed home a cross from Angel Montoro in the 49th minute. Hopefully, the remaining 378 (377 now that Osasuna and Cadiz have played) matches this season brings the free-scoring play that La Liga is known for.

      <h10><b>3. Both Of Granada’s Goals Scored By Debutants</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Well, technically today wasn’t Yangel Herrera’s debut, as he was on loan at Granada last season, but as he did return to Manchester City over the summer before Granada decided to extend his loan another year, it was counted as a debut by the league. He scored his third goal for the club on Saturday and dominated the midfield for his side. Granada will be very happy that they have him for another season (and should look to sign him permanently).
On the other hand, today was officially the debut for midfielder Luis Milla, who was signed from La Liga Smartbank side CD Tenerife for €4.6 million. He played very well against Athletic, and he scored a rocket in the 53rd minute to secure the win for Granada. He is very good at progressing the ball from deep and winning the ball back, all while playing a box-to-box role. If he continues to perform as he did on Saturday he will become a key cog in Granda’s midfield for years to come.

      <h10><b>4. Athletic Will Need To Make Signings Or Risk Having Another Poor Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Athletic have no problem keeping possession, their midfield is adept at keeping the ball from their opponents. They have issues, however, in creating chances. On Saturday there was very little link-up play between the midfielders and the forwards, and it showed on the scoresheet. I am a huge fan of Iker Muniain, I love the way he plays, but he isn’t the player he used to be (which is sad, as he’s only 27). He was rarely on the ball on Saturday, and he was invisible off of it. Raul Garcia is good as well, but I prefer him as a second striker along with Inaki Williams as opposed to an attacking midfielder. Athletic need to sign someone who can link the midfield to the attack. It will be tough to find someone due to their transfer policy and lack of funds, but if they are able to bring in someone, they should. They need a player who will compete with Muniain for the starting spot, to spur him to rediscover his form of past seasons. I suggest Luca Sangalli from Real Sociedad. He’s 24 years old and Basque born and should come cheap as he hasn’t featured often at La Real.

      <h10><b>5. Four-Point Cushion Practically Ensures Real Madrid the Title</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I see Granada continuing at the level they finished last season at, but not improving too much. I think that they could get much better if they bring in some bigger names, but with the players that they have, I believe that they have peaked. I think that they will finish in an upper mid-table position, between 10th and 8th. I don’t see them grabbing a Europa League spot only because I think that some teams that underperformed last season (Real Betis, Valencia), will finish higher this season, and push Granada down a few spots. I also think that the increase in the number of matches that they will play, due to being in the Europa League will take a toll on the squad. The club doesn’t have the depth to perform consistently for 60 games this season.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I think that Athletic Club will replicate their form from last season, and finish between 12th and 10th. They haven’t made any signings since last season, and I don’t expect them to magically get better. I expect manager Gaizka Garitano to be sacked before December, and a new manager will be forced to recover their season.
