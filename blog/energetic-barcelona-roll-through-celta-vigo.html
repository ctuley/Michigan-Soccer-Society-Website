      <h12><b>Final Score: FC Barcelona 3-0 Real Club Celta de Vigo</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After a dominant opener of the La Liga season against Villareal, everyone’s eyes were on Barcelona on Thursday as they looked to recreate their success for a second game in a row. This Celta Vigo side came in hot and, as Ray Hudson put it, has been the “absolute Dracula” to Barcelona in recent years (whatever that means, I’m sure he’s right). As the match opened up, Barcelona aggressively dominated the possession in Celta Vigo’s half, pushing until Ansu Fati opened the scoresheet in the 11th minute. They essentially possessed around Celta Vigo’s box until the 41st minute where Clement Lenglet earned himself a red card. Lionel Messi doubled Barcelona’s lead in the 51st minute via a Lucas Olaza own goal, and they didn’t let Celta Vigo join the scoresheet themselves. After an uneventful 40 minutes of play, Sergi Roberto nearly ripped the Celta Vigo net with a wide open stoppage time volley, putting the dagger in the opposition and ensuring 3 points for Barcelona.

      <h10><b>1. Barcelona Not Reliant on Messi</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Early in the match, Barcelona’s attack seemed much less reliant on Lionel Messi than it has been in recent seasons. The front 4 of Lionel Messi, Ansu Fati, Philippe Coutinho, and Antoine Griezmann shared the ball very effectively and essentially played “positionless” football by fluidly filling each others’ space. If anything, Messi didn’t touch the ball much for his standards in the first 20 minutes of the match. Commentator Phil Schoen even noticed it as he claimed “Barcelona seems to be using Messi as a decoy”. This dynamic attack, which also involved the midfield of Sergio Busquets and Frenkie De Jong, did a great job of dominating possession in Celta Vigo’s backyard and eventually pushing for an Ansu Fati opening goal. Overall, Barcelona’s attack played with urgency and looked less reliant on Messi despite losing Luis Suarez.

      <h10><b>2. Ansu Fati is Special</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      This shouldn’t be news, but if anyone didn’t know yet from last season they now know. Ansu Fati is a SPECIAL football player. The youngster already has 3 goals after 2 league matches, and his dribbling ability stood out in this match. Fati created his goal off a beautiful one-touch pass into the box by Coutinho, where he impressively pushed the ball past a few defenders with his first touch and raced past them to slot it into the bottom left. At a club that has been yearning for youth development, the 17-year old doesn’t just meet the standards for a young talent. He EXCEEDS them. In a year where Barcelona has embarrassed itself more than enough times on and off the pitch, it’s nice for the fans to know that they have something to look forward to in the future.

      <h10><b>3. Barcelona Defense Vulnerable Despite Clean Sheet</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Yes, the Barcelona Defense earned a clean sheet, but don’t let that fool you. They did not look very poised today. While Barcelona mainly dominated the possession in Celta Vigo’s half, there were moments where Celta Vigo was able to quickly counter and they actually looked quite menacing in the first half. They were not able to penetrate Barcelona’s defense in the attacking third, but I believe that can be attributed to a lack of creativity on Celta Vigo’s part rather than to a strong Barcelona defense. Barca’s defense proved to be struggling particularly when Clement Lenglet received his 2nd yellow card just before half time for elbowing Denis Suarez in the face on a Celta Vigo counterattack. Being up just 1-0, Barcelona was forced to pull Griezmann off the field for Ronald Araujo, the young Uruguayan center back. The defensive pairing of Pique and Araujo was lucky to hold onto their clean sheet in the 2nd half as Messi and company impressively continued to maintain efficient possession despite playing with 10 men.

      <h10><b>4. Koeman Responds Well to Lenglet Red Card</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      While Koeman’s managerial career at Barcelona was off to a shaky start before the team saw the field, his squad has played well in their first two league matches. His 4-2-3-1 with Coutinho as the central CAM and Messi at the nominal striker position (although he looked more like a false-9) has proven to be much quicker deadlier than Valverde’s and Setien’s attacks so far. As impressive as this offensive rejuvenation has been, I was thoroughly impressed with the squad’s ability to adapt to Lenglet’s red card, and Koeman gets a lot of credit for that. After dominating the possession 68%-32% in the first half, Koeman did not take his foot off the gas, even while playing a man down. The attack still looked as deadly as ever despite having to drop Coutinho to a box-to-box role and leaving Messi and Fati alone in the attack (this isn’t surprising as Messi is one of the greatest attackers of all time). The decision to employ the 4-3-2 clearly paid off as Barcelona was still able to score twice and not concede at all in the 2nd half. Barcelona ended the match winning the possession battle 56%-44%, which is very impressive for a squad that was down to 10 men for an entire half.

      <h10><b>5. Celta Vigo Could Not Capitalize</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      At the end of the day goals earn wins in football. Celta Vigo was given an outstanding opportunity with Lenglet being sent off, and yet they still couldn’t take advantage of it. Denis Suarez was extremely uncreative at the CAM position while the striker, Iago Aspas, looked non-existent. Celta Vigo actually ended the game with more shots than Barcelona, but only 4 of them were on target and none of them really tested Neto, the Barcelona keeper. Ronald Araujo, Barcelona’s young center back who replaced Lenglet, was rarely ever mentioned by the commentators in the half that he played, which tells one how little he was actually tested. Ultimately, Barcelona was able to keep the ball away from Celta Vigo, and even when they had the ball they squandered their few chances. When coming up against a team that likes to possess as much as Barcelona does, one can only beat them if they capitalize on their chances, and Celta Vigo’s inability to do that gave them a slim chance of winning.
