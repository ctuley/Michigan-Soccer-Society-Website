      <h12><b>Final Score: Orlando City 2 - 1 Inter Miami</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        MLS became the United States’ first major sports league to return last night, kicking off their restart tournament in Orlando, Florida. Naturally, the opening match was the first ever all-Florida derby match between Orlando and Miami. Miami, searching for their first win, struck first just after halftime, but Orlando staged a second half comeback to win the first game of the tournament. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Orlando Get a Big Win in First All-Florida Derby</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was a big night for Orlando City. They are technically the hosts of the tournament, so the club was put center stage to kick off MLS’s restart. What better way to do it than to have them face new local rivals Inter Miami. The first ever match in this new rivalry was filled with drama, even if the players looked a bit rusty in their first game back. Orlando struggled to break Miami down for much of the game, and after going down 1-0 just after halftime, their prospects were not looking good. However, Orlando’s captain Nani - who missed the first two games of the season - was back in the starting XI and spearheaded a late comeback that included a 97th minute winner from the skipper. It was a big three points that could prove crucial in deciding who goes through in Group A.

              <h13>
                Though Miami were often pushed back and forced to defend for much of the game, They were by no means dominated by Orlando. In fact, Miami even had the best chance in the scoreless first half. A cross from Pellegrini on the left found Juan Agudelo free just outside the six yard box, but the striker was unable to direct the shot on target. It was a really bad miss that, while possibly explained by rustiness, should surely be put in the back of the net every time. In a game where one chance seemed like it could have been the difference maker, scoring there may have put Miami on the path to winning the game. Agudelo was able to redeem himself by scoring the opening goal of the game just after halftime, but Miami were unable to stop the late comeback from Orlando after defender Andrés Reyes went off injured just after the hour mark. Would a goal from Agudelo in those opening stages have changed the outcome of the match? Maybe, but if Miami is going to succeed playing a more defensive brand of soccer, they need to take every chance that’s given to them in the attacking third.

      <h10><b>3. Nani’s Quality the Difference Maker</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Orlando’s best player was always going to be their X-factor in this game. After missing the first two games of this season, Nani continued on his stellar form from last season by putting in a man of the match performance against Orlando’s new rivals. Always a threat down the left side during the match, Nani’s dribbling and passing opened up the game and gave Miami plenty of trouble. Though he was drawing fouls and creating chances all game, it wasn’t until late on that it really came to anything. After providing the assist off a great low cross to the back post for the equalizer in the 70th minute, Nani found himself in a great position to score the winner from close range in th 97th minute. Though it wasn’t great defending from Miami, Nani showed good composure to finish first time past Luis Robles.

      <h10><b>4. Scary Moment as Andrés Reyes is Stretchered Off</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Just before the hour mark, there was a scary coming together between Miami’s Andrés Reyes and Orlando’s Dom Dwyer. Dwyer appeared to (unintentionally) elbow Reyes in the throat, which left the Miami defender writhing on the ground in pain, struggling to catch his breath. Reyes was stretchered off the field and was taken to a local hospital. Thankfully, he appears to be doing okay, having been released from the hospital last night. He will continue to be monitored and will need to be tested for COVID after leaving the bubble. In terms of the impact of this moment on the match, Reyes’s injury forced Miami to change shape from a back five to a back four with the introduction of attacking midfielder Rodolfo Pizzaro. This no doubt affected Miami’s defensive stability, and Orlando’s late push brought two goals and took all three points from the match.

      <h10><b>5. MLS Gives Us Insight Into the Return of Other Major American Sports Leagues</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        By being the first major sports league back in the United States, MLS now has the opportunity to set a blueprint for how other leagues - like the NBA or MLB - can look to return. It hasn’t always been easy to get to this point - Dallas and Nashville have already been forced to drop out of the tournament - but MLS has an opportunity to show how well the bubble can work. The NBA will likely be watching intently, as they are taking the route most similar to MLS in terms of their return. They too are creating a bubble at the Disney World Resorts in Orlando where they will play out the rest of their season at ESPN’s Wide World of Sports complex. All eyes will be on the league to see how they handle it, and a successful return could greatly boost the profile of MLS to something more than just “America’s Fifth Sport”.
