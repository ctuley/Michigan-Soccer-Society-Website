    <h12><b>Final Score: Valencia 4-1 Real Madrid</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      A Carlos Soler hat trick of penalties and a Rafael Varane own-goal, were more than enough for Valencia to take down Real Madrid in an upset that poses an early threat to Madrid’s title aspirations. Here are my five key takeaways:

            Since Zidane re-joined Real Madrid in early 2019, he has started Marcelo a total of 28 times. Real Madrid have lost 9 of those 28. In the 29 matches that Marcelo has not started for Real Madrid, they have not lost. Purely based on that statistic alone, I am dumbfounded that Zidane continues to play the Brazilian, even when you factor in Marcelo’s legendary status at the club. He was horrible against Valencia, conceding 1 penalty, and was partially guilty for Varane’s own goal, as the attack came down the left flank that he was supposed to defend. He was also caught napping as the first penalty was being taken, as he stood adjusting his socks, allowing Yunus Musah to finish the rebound from Thibaut Courtois’s initial save (the penalty did have to be retaken due to Real Madrid players entering the penalty area before the kick was taken, so Musah’s goal was taken away). This was surely a match for Ferland Mendy, as the Frenchman has been better than Marcelo in every way this season, and his defensive capabilities would have been better suited to contain the pace and dynamism of Yunus Musah. This is on both Zidane, for his poor team selection, and Marcelo, for his poor performances. I honestly don’t expect Zidane to bench Marcelo for an extended period, but this will surely be his last season at the club, as it is evident that he is well past his time.

    <h10><b>2. ...But The Rest Of Real Madrid’s Defense Were Not Any Better</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While Marcelo’s performance was particularly terrible, it would be unjust not to mention how poor the rest of Real Madrid’s defense played. The defensive line was way too high, allowing Valencia to catch the team out on easy counter-attacks (which has been a common theme so far this season. I believe that it’s due to overconfidence from winning the title last year, similar to what Liverpool are experiencing in the Premier League). Lucas Vazquez (who has been one of the most inconsistent performers I’ve ever seen this season) was terrible, giving up the penalty that lead to Valencia’s first goal, and was the Madrid player who entered the penalty area during Carlos Soler’s first attempt (that was saved) forcing the penalty to be retaken. Rafael Varane, who has also been wildly inconsistent this season, was unfortunate to score an own-goal against Valencia, as he misplayed a clearance in his own penalty area, flicking the ball into his own net. Varane wasn’t terrible other than that, but it wasn’t the normal solid shift that he normally puts in. Sergio Ramos rounded out the night with a penalty for Valencia as well, as he smacked the ball out of the penalty area with his hand when under pressure by Yunus Musah. I have no idea if it was intentional or not, but I’m genuinely surprised that Ramos didn’t see a red card for his offense. Overall, it was a horrible night for Real Madrid’s defense, as each member of the backline finished the night with a goal contribution for the opposition. Luckily, the team has two weeks (international break) to sort out their issues.

    <h10><b>3. Carlos Soler Looks Really Good (On Paper)</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Soler scored the first hat trick of his career against Real Madrid, bagging 3 penalties against the former champions. That takes him to 4 goals in his last 2 matches, all of them being penalties. Other than his excellence from the penalty spot, it was a quiet night for Soler, as he did well leading Valencia’s midfield. As he is a former winger, I’m always surprised at how defensively competent he is, and how well he’s adapted to the attacking midfielder role at only 23 years of age. Now that he is on penalties for Valencia, expect him to score quite a few goals this season, and with Messi, Benzema, and Suarez getting off to slower starts in the league, he could be a wild-card shout at La Liga’s top scorer at the end of the season (he has 4 goals in 5 appearances this season, 2 goals off of the leader, Mikel Oyarzabal).

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Can This Win Start A Hot-Streak For Valencia?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Had Valencia not won this match, they would have been in 16th place in La Liga, a massive gap from the 9th place position where they currently sit. I was seriously concerned that Valencia could be relegation contenders, as they had lost so many key players over the summer. However, after their win over Real Madrid, I believe that Valencia may be renewed, and with the core group of talented youngsters that they have, they could blossom into a great team. It all depends on Javi Gracia’s coaching, and if he can get the best out of all of his players. Valencia travel to Alaves (a match that they should win) after the international break and then face Atletico Madrid a week later, which will be a much tougher test. Time will only tell if this Valencia win was a product of good performances and coaching or a fluke win due to mistakes by the opposition.

    <h10><b>5. Is Zidane Under Pressure?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In short: I don’t think so. Zidane always seems to pull off huge wins whenever he comes under pressure as Real Madrid manager, and I don’t think this time will be any different. Even though Madrid currently sit 4th in La Liga and 3rd in their Champions League group, it’s not as bad as it looks. Real Madrid have a game in hand in La Liga, which would take them to second place in the table if they win, and the first half of the Champions League group stage results will most likely not be replicated. Besides, the board knows that the squad is struggling with injuries and COVID-19 cases, and Zidane is not at fault for either of those. I expect Real Madrid to come out flying in their next match against an incredibly tough Villarreal side, as Los Blancos (and Zidane) will view it as a must-win match in the race to win La Liga.
