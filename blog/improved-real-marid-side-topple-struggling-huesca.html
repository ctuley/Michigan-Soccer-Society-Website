    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 4-1 Huesca</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Goals from Eden Hazard, Fede Valverde, and a brace from Karim Benzema were enough to see Real Madrid beat La Liga newcomers Huesca in comfortable fashion. Here are my five key takeaways:

            I won’t lie, I was very nervous coming into this match. Seeing that Real Madrid had won 1 of their last 4 matches, I had no idea what to expect from the team against Huesca. I had no doubt that Huesca would roll out a low-block system, where they would sit in and absorb Real Madrid’s possession, and then try and catch them out on the counter-attack. This is exactly what they did, and for the majority of the first half, Huesca placed 10 of their 11 men inside their own penalty area and forced Real Madrid to try and play around their wall of men. Huesca were comfortable in this position, and it was evident that they would be satisfied to walk away from this match with a draw if it meant taking points off of Real Madrid. Up until the 40th minute, it looked bleak for Real Madrid, until Eden Hazard decided to have a go from 30 yards out...

    <h10><b>2. It’s Nice To Have A Superstar In Madrid Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Eden Hazard changed the match against Huesca. First, he is a fantastic transition player, something that Real Madrid have sorely missed in their past few games. Hazard likes to run at defenses, and unlike Madrid’s only other dribbler, Vinicius Jr., he is good at it. In the 40th minute Hazard took a shot from 25-30 yards out, and he threw Huesca keeper Andres Fernandez for a loop, giving him a winding knuckle-ball that was near-impossible to stop. Real Madrid took the lead, and this changed the match drastically. Now Huesca had to attack, they would gain nothing from sitting in and maintaining the low-block while they were losing. This opened up Huesca’s defense and midfield and allowed Karim Benzema to grab a goal only 5 minutes after, which only increased Huesca’s desperation. I can confidently say this match would have been drastically different without the Belgian.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While Madrid’s squad is undeniably one of the best in the world, they have lacked a serious “game-changer” since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo. If Eden Hazard can stay healthy and continue to put in performances like he did against Huesca, he could become Real Madrid’s key player this season and can begin to justify his massive price tag.

    <h10><b>3. Benzema Finally Finds His Form</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Benzema bagged his 2nd and 3rd La Liga goals against Huesca, and the Frenchman will be relieved that he is beginning to find his shooting boots after a recent dry spell in front of goal. As Benzema has always been the focal point of each Madrid attack when Benzema struggles, Madrid struggles, so it’s very good to have him back amongst the goals. His first goal came from a Lucas Vazquez cross that he settled with his chest in a wide position, and volleyed home, with the ball deflecting off Andres Fernandez’s hand. The shot probably would have gone wide without the touch from Fernandez, but it was a good finish nevertheless. The second goal came in the final minute of regulation, when Rodrygo headed a cross to Benzema, who used his own head to find the back of the net from very close range, sealing the win for Los Blancos. Benzema will be hoping that he can extend his scoring form (3 goals in his last 2 matches) into Real Madrid’s next match, a must-win Champions League tie with Inter Milan.

    <h10><b>4. Is This The End Of Isco In Madrid?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Spanish midfielder has never really been a regular under Zidane, as the French manager has never preferred to utilize an attacking midfielder in his formations. Isco has been vocal lately about his lack of play-time, and Zidane gave him half an hour against Huesca to try and see if he could make an impact and justify his complaints. In his half-hour, Isco completed 24 out of 25 passes, a great tally, but the Spaniard didn’t attempt a single key pass or a single pass into the penalty area. While he was solid in possession, he failed to make any real impact on the match, and at times it was easy to forget that he was even on the pitch. It’s fair to assume that this will be Isco’s last season in the Spanish capital, as he will join a team that can guarantee him regular minutes (especially before the 2022 World Cup, as he will want to prove that he should be in Spain’s squad).

          After their match against Real Madrid, Huesca sit in 18th place, 1 point below safety (*note: they have played 8 matches this season, with 19th place Levante having played 6, and 20th place Real Valladolid having played 7). Huesca haven’t won a match this season, and despite draws with Atletico Madrid and Villarreal (among others), they haven’t looked to be La Liga quality. They have conceded the most goals in La Liga this season (14), and they aren’t scoring anywhere near enough goals to offset that. Their play is very disciplined, and, as seen in their performances against Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, they can put up good performances against even the best teams in La Liga. Despite their good performances, they are very mistake-prone, and this has cost them games and points this season. At this time, I can safely say that, unless the club undergoes massive changes, Huesca will not be in La Liga next season.
