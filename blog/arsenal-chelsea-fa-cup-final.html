      <h12><b>Final Score: Arsenal 2 - 1 Chelsea</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There was plenty to play for in this all-London FA Cup final. For Chelsea, the chance for Frank Lampard to finish up a relatively successful first season with a trophy. For Arsenal, the chance for Mikel Arteta to pick up a statement win and for Arsenal to qualify for the Europa League. In the end, the Gunners prevailed, and Arteta won his first trophy as Arsenal manager. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Arsenal At Their Best When Playing Direct</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Something that would have been unthinkable in the Wenger era, today Arsenal were at their very best when playing direct balls into the left channel to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. It was with this tactic that they created their first goal - Kieran Tierney launching the ball towards Aubambeyang who used his pace to force a foul in the box by Cesar Azpilicueta. Aubameyang scored the penalty, and his running in behind caused trouble for the right side of Chelsea’s defense all game. The second goal came when Hector Bellerin carried the ball forward from deep and forced a tackle from Andreas Christensen. Pepe picked up the ball after Bellerin was tackled, dribbled on the edge of the box before playing to Aubameyang who made a nice move past Kurt Zouma before finishing to make it 2-1. Arteta was expected to implement a Guardiola-esque possession-oriented system, but with the personnel at his disposal, it seems as though Arteta has realized he may need to play more direct to succeed until he can bring in players that suit his style.

      <h10><b>2. Chelsea Unlucky With Injuries, But Could Learn A Tactical Lesson From Arsenal</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite giving Arsenal trouble early with a more direct approach on offense, after Christian Pulisic scored the opener Chelsea got a bit more conservative. They seemed happy to keep it at 1-0 by keeping possession among the center-backs and trying to build from deep. Unfortunately, this plan backfired as Arsenal were able to apply pressure and get back into the game with their own direct approach. Despite having three attackers - Giroud, Pulisic, and Mount - who thrive when attacking directly, Lampard still kept the same approach. By the time they started to go back to the more direct approach, Pulisic had already come off injured and their chance to take back the lead was gone. Had Pulisic and Azpilicueta not gone down, the result may have been different. But Lampard failed to adapt in time, and he needed to get his midfielders and defenders to start putting pressure on the Arsenal backline long before he actually did.

      <h10><b>3. Something Needs To Be Done About The Refereeing Situation In England</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Referee Anthony Taylor was probably the biggest beneficiary of there being no fans in the stands for this game because Chelsea fans likely wouldn’t have let him leave. There were two massive decisions missed by the referee in this game. The first was the second yellow card for Mateo Kovacic when the midfielder fouled Granit Xhaka with his follow-through on a tackle. It was an incredibly soft foul, and I don’t see how you can give it a card. And if you thought it was a foul, fine, but to not even have VAR look at it is a horrendous use of the technology. It’s there to fix potentially game-changing mistakes and it did not do its job. The same goes for the second decision where Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez appeared to grab the ball outside of the penalty area. If he didn’t, so be it, but at least have VAR look at it to make sure the right decision was made. Unfortunately, this is all par for the course for English soccer this season. The first year of VAR has been a huge misfire on the FA’s part. It’s been used well in other competitions, but England wants to do it its own way. That way is the wrong way. Fix it.

      <h10><b>4. Chelsea's Needs Are Loud And Clear</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Chelsea showed potential in their first season under Frank Lampard, but they’ve still got a long way to go if they want to compete with Liverpool and Manchester City. Chelsea’s attack has looked fine all season and should be even stronger with the additions of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech. However, the FA Cup Final - and really most of this season - showed where Chelsea’s transfer strategy needs to go from here. No, they do not need to spend €80 million on Kai Havertz. I understand that you don’t want to pass up on an opportunity to sign a player like him when it appears, but there are bigger issues in the squad that that money should go towards. A new goalkeeper, for one. Caballero wasn’t bad himself in the final, but the fact that the 38-year-old needed to start over the club-record signing is a sign they need a new goalkeeper. Another center-back or two wouldn’t hurt. A more dynamic one with more ability on the ball than what they currently have would be nice, though it will be hard to find for a good price. A left-back, because Marcos Alonso showed today that even when he’s played in a system where he doesn’t need to defend, he still isn’t all that good. Chelsea may think they are closer than they actually are to challenging the top two, but it’s still a long road ahead. Thankfully, the path is clear to see.

      <h10><b>5. This Was A Massive Win For Arsenal’s Future</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I’m a big believer in Mikel Arteta, and I think if he’s given time and financial backing he can bring success back to Arsenal. Winning the FA Cup was a huge victory for him and the club for a couple of reasons. 1) There will not be as much pressure to rush the rebuild with a trophy now to his name. Arteta has proven that he can win silverware as a manager  - albeit not always in convincing fashion - and the FA Cup victory should satisfy the fans until Arteta can get the club where he thinks it can be. 2) Arsenal have now qualified for next season’s Europa League. There is an argument to be made that maybe a season not in Europe would be best for the new manager to really implement his system. It worked with Klopp when he came in at Liverpool and with Conte when he came in at Chelsea. But I think it’s more important that Arsenal compete in Europe next season because their financial situation would not be looking great if they missed out. Okay, the club would still be one of the richest in the world, but they would be falling way behind their rivals by missing out on not just another year of Champions League action, but European competition all together. There is promise in what Arteta is trying to do with Arsenal, he just needs some time.
