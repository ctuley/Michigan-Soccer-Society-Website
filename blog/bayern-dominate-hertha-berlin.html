      <h12><b>Final Score: Bayern Münich 4 -1 Hertha Berlin</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>Bayern Munich rained down 30 shots against Hertha Berlin, scoring four with a further two cancelled after VAR review for a 4-1 victory on the road. Here are five key takeaways:</h13>

      <h10><b>1. Bayern Munich returned to near full-strength ahead of key game in the next match day</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Davies and Goretzka are still absent from the team sheet and Nagelsmann has to get creative with his midfield setup. Lucas Hernandez and Kingsley Coman were cleared for play after contacting COVID and joined the starting lineup today. Their addition to the roster is welcomed, with Bayern preparing to face Leipzig in two weeks.

        Hernandez’s timely return adds stability to the backline by providing a reliable replacement for Davies in the left back position. In the center of the defense, Niklas Sule kept Upamecano on the bench and formed a partnership with Pavard. The system had Tolisso playing as the single pivot in front of the defenders and Kimmich returning to his old position as the right back. Nagelsmann shows off Bayern’s attacking depth by fielding Coman, Sane, Muller, and Gnabry behind Lewandowski upfront.

      <h10><b>2. Bayern turned on the aggression with three-at-the-back</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was apparent from the beginning of the game that Bayern Munich planned to play the game in Hertha Berlin’s half. Kimmich pushed up into the defensive midfield position, freeing Tolisso to move upfield and join Sane and Muller in the center of the field. Tolisso scored on the volley after only two minutes from a cross but was offside. Behind Kimmich, Hernandez, Sule, and Pavard formed an asymmetrical line that shifted laterally with the ball. This formation, a 3-1-5-1, has seen some usage in recent games to accommodate the lack of aggressive fullbacks and the steady defensive performance of Goretzka.

        Bayern attempted to protect itself from exposure in transitory moments by putting on the pressure as soon as Hertha Berlin gained possession. Kimmich paired up with Tolisso to hunt down the opponent midfielders while the other attackers chased down the defender in possession. Interestingly, Berlin refused to resort to long balls but their attempts at playing out on the ground were effectively shut down. As a result, Hertha Berlin frequently turned the ball over in their defensive and middle third. The plot below illustrates where Hertha Berlin lost possesion:

      <h10><b>3. Lewandowski’s silence puts other attackers in the highlight</b></h10>
      <br></br>
            <h13>
              Lewandowski had a disappointing night, failing to score despite an above-average 1.22 xG, a testament to the effective coverage by Hertha Berlin’s defenders. The tight coverage however, left space for other players. Muller’s intelligent movement pulled the defenders away to allow Tolisso’s header and led to one of his own, in an admittedly bizarre fashion, off of a free kick towards the end of the first half.
              Sane continued his good form after Nagelsmann converted him into a central role this season to accommodate Davies’s aggressive runs down the flank. Sane had 93 touches in this game and is a valuable presence in the midfield, linking play between Kimmich and the other attackers. His signature dribbling ability allowed him to go into space after receiving the ball and create time for himself to dispatch the ball. His 89.6% pass success rate and clever 1-2s were key to the fluidity of Bayern’s attacking moves. Sane further topped it off with a goal after he hustled for an interception in the box. The heatmap below shows his activity this game:

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. Tolisso’s surprise showing</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Tolisso has gotten some match time recently due to Goretzka’s injury. A long time substitute whose contract expires in six months, he is rumored to be moving to the Premier League at the end of the season. Tolisso is a man of many surprises, equally adept at scoring brilliant goals and making egregious defensive mistakes. His performance today fell into the former category, getting away from two defenders to head the ball into the net. He again proved that he is more effective in an offensive role rather than playing as a 6 by being active in pressing situations and generally picking out sensible passes. While he ranks highly against other midfields in attacking stats, his defensive performance has room for improvement.

  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>5. Upamecano’s rough start continues</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
            Upamecano has had a less-than-desirable start at his new club, clouded by unconvincing performance against star strikers such as Haaland and Schick. He replaced Sule at the 81st minute, and his  first touch of the ball was a weak pass that failed to reach Neuer, leading to Hertha Berlin’s only goal.
            It is worth noting that despite Upamecano being most prized for his ability to get forward, Sule’s ability to get forward often goes under appreciated. Sule ranks in the 95th percentile in progressive passes and averages 88% in progressive carries among defenders.
