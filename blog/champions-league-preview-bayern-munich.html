      Despite their early struggles in the Bundesliga, a mid-season switch in managers has seemingly turned Bayern Munich into arguably the most dominant force in Europe right now. Since appointing new manager Hansi Flick, Bayern have lost just two games and none since the first week of December. Granted, they didn’t play for two months in that span, but the break seemed to give Bayern a needed rest that allowed key players to get healthy and refresh enough to dominate the Bundesliga post-restart.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The expectations for the club is clear: they need to win the Champions League. The current core of players is on their last legs, and despite the wealth of great young talent coming through, it could be a while before Bayern have as good a shot to be champions of Europe as they do right now. The good news is this current group of players is primed to do just that. This squad is packed with more than enough talent to win the Champions League. The road ahead will be tough, but this team is more than equipped to get the job done.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With last season’s champions, Liverpool knocked out of the competition, it seems Bayern Munich might be the team to beat heading into the final stages. They should finish off an injury-riddled Chelsea squad in the Round of 16 after bringing a 3-0 lead into the second leg, but they’ve drawn the harder route to the final and a first Champions League title since 2013 isn’t a forgone conclusion just yet.

    <h10><b>How Will They Line Up:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      There are doubts surrounding the fitness of right-back Benjamin Pavard after he suffered an ankle injury in training last week. He will be out for the Chelsea match, but the rumor is he may be ready to go for the rest of the tournament after that. For the purposes of this preview, I will be assuming Pavard is healthy and will start after the Round of 16 - and if he isn’t, expect Joshua Kimmich to slot in at right-back in his place.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <div class="row-articles">
      <div class="column-articles">
        <div class="card-articles">
          <h13>
            Apart from the injury to Pavard that will cause some rotation, there isn’t a whole lot of doubt as to who Bayern will send out on the field. The front four should remain the same with Robert Lewandowski in front of Kingsley Coman, Thomas Müller, and Serge Gnabry. The backline should also remain nearly the same - apart from Pavard - with Jerome Boateng and David Alaba playing centrally, Alphonso Davies on the left, and Manuel Neuer in between the sticks. This was the core of the best defense in the Bundesliga, and I don’t expect it to change too much.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            In terms of tactics, expect a high-intensity-pressing 4-2-3-1 combined with patient buildup play in possession. When they have the ball, Bayern will play with a high defensive line, using the pace of players like Alphonso Davies to cover behind if they are caught out. Expect Coman and Gnabry to get in the box often to support Lewandowski and offer goal threats themselves - they both actually registered more touches in the penalty area per 90 than Lewandowski in the Bundesliga (fbref.com). Müller will be pulling the strings and shouldering most of the creative burden from open play, though he will be assisted from set-pieces by Joshua Kimmich. This shouldn’t be too much to ask from him though as he averaged 0.51 expected assists, 3.26 key passes, and 5.23 shot-creating actions per 90 in the Bundesliga this season (fbref.com).

    <h10><b>Player To Watch:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Joshua Kimmich (Age: 25; Position: DM, MC, RB):</b><h12>
      <br></br>
    <h13>
      All eyes will likely be on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski - and for good reason - but I think the player to keep an eye on here is midfielder/defender Joshua Kimmich. He’s adapted well this season to his new defensive midfielder role, and Kimmich really is the player that keeps Bayern ticking. He’s the most involved in buildup in the team, he’s got more progressive passes per 90 than anyone else, and he’s a huge creative threat from set-pieces. He’s a press-resistant midfielder that’s cool and collected in possession, and I think he is the most important cog in the Bayern Munich machine. It will be interesting to see if/how his influence changes if he is forced to move to right-back in the absence of Pavard, but Kimmich will likely remain an important part of the team no matter where he plays.
    </h13>
    <img src="../blog-img/champions-league-preview-bayern-munich/champions-league-preview-bayern-munich-4.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;padding-bottom:30px;">
    <h10><b>Prediction: Champions</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      This prediction may seem bold to some people, but I believe Bayern Munich have the best combination of talent, tactics, and form of any team still left in the competition. They are in the tougher half of the bracket, but once they take care of Chelsea, they should be able to take care of either Barcelona or Napoli - two teams underperforming at the moment. Their toughest opponent in the competition will come in the semifinal, where they will likely meet the winner of Manchester City and Real Madrid. They could face a Ronaldo-led Juventus, but they’ve been underwhelming recently and still need to turn around a 1-0 deficit against Lyon. I think Bayern are (slightly) stronger than any of these teams and they should beat whoever comes out of the other side of the bracket should they make it to the final - especially now that PSG might be without Kylian Mbappe. This feels like the 1998 Chicago Bulls “Last Dance” for the current core of players. Bayern Munich will be back at the top soon, but this will likely be their last (and best) chance to be Champions of Europe for the time being.
