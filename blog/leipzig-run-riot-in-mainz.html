    <h12><b>Final Score: FSV Mainz 0 - 5 RB Leipzig</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      RB Leipzig thrashed FSV Mainz with a 5-0 win to move into 3rd place and stay in the hunt for the title. A Timo Werner hat-trick and strikes from Yussuf Poulsen and Marcel Sabitzer ensured that Leipzig completely dominated the game. Here are 5 takeaways.

    <h10><b>1. Timo Werner is Back at his Best</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Following a disappointing performance in Leipzig’s 1-1 draw to Freiburg last week, Werner broke his scoring drought of 1 goal in 8 games with an impressive hat-trick. Hungry for goals and to prove his qualities, Werner showcased his lightning-fast pace and lethal finishing as he punished the Mainz defense. His first goal came from his well-timed positioning as he latched on to a Konrad Laimer cross. His second goal was a result of intricate play from Kevin Kampl as he slotted past Mainz goalie Florian Müller in close range. He capped out his hat trick on the end of a clever Poulsen free-kick. With his second hat trick against Mainz this season, Werner must wish he could play them every week.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The hat trick puts Werner at 27 goals, three behind Robert Lewandowski in the race for the Torjägerkanone. Although both players are unlikely to break Gerd Müller’s record of 40 goals with just 7 games remaining, they each look to tear apart defenses. Leipzig’s fast-paced attack and Mainz’s terrible defending exploited Werner’s strengths. Only time will tell when Werner eventually ends up with a big-money transfer to a club like Liverpool.

    <h10><b>2. Peak Nagelsmann Football</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      This performance was simply Julian Nagelsmann at its finest. On a better day with more clinical finishing, Leipzig could have easily surpassed the 8 goals in their previous encounter with Mainz and possibly have gone into double digits. Leipzig was in full control of the game and never looked back. Their intensity was unmatched by Mainz and they fought for every second ball and took advantage of any lapse in concentration. Leipzig was ruthless with their pressing and that was shown when Sabitzer stripped the ball in midfield leading to a quick transition for the second goal. Leipzig dominated all aspects of the game crushing Mainz in shots on target 10-1 and expected goals 5.27-0.32 <i>(understat.com)</i>.

    <h10><b>3. Kampl is the Engine in Midfield</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Although Werner rightly received most of the plaudits, Kevin Kampl controlled the game from midfield. He epitomized how Leipzig completely dominated opponents with quick ball movement and his passing opened up many opportunities for Werner, Poulsen, and Sabitzer. Overall, his clever touches and passes dictated the tempo of the game bringing calmness and composure to Leipzig. Werner’s second goal was set up on a platter by Kampl’s vision and one-two with Christopher Nkunku. On his day, Kampl is one of the top midfielders in the Bundesliga and the world.

          <h13>
            Although they played a strong Leipzig side and will have more forgiving fixtures later, Mainz looked completely out of their depth. Their defending was appalling and affording the likes of Werner so much space is never a good idea. The whole back-line was very sloppy and late with their challenges and reactions. Mainz defenders seemed like they were casually strolling around when Werner scored his second and Leipzig’s fourth while Poulsen was left completely unmarked for a free header for the second goal. In the end, Müller looked like he’d completely given up when Werner poked in his third goal. The heavy loss leaves Mainz in 15th place hovering above the relegation zone. Having already fired Sandro Schwarz earlier in the season, Mainz will be expecting a lot from Achim Beierlorzer to keep them in the Bundesliga.

    <h10><b>5. Poulsen is the Perfect Foil to Werner</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Werner’s job is made a lot easier by Yussuf Poulsen’s work rate and clever positioning. The Danish striker was a menace for the Mainz defenders to deal with. Besides his impressive stats with his goal and two assists - a header, the pass to Sabitzer, and a clever free-kick, Poulsen’s physicality and pressing in harassing defenders provide Werner the space to use his pace. His ability to draw defenders was evident in the first goal when he shields a Mainz center back giving Werner the space to receive the cross. Poulsen’s efforts compliment Werner’s skillsets flawlessly and it's the reason why Werner and Leipzig have been able to thrive. His presence is essential to the RB Leipzig team and his impact is shown beyond the stat sheet.
