      <h12><b>Final Score: Louisville City 1 - 3 Pittsburgh Riverhounds</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was a big moment for Louisville and USL on Sunday as the new Lynn Family Stadium finally opened its doors. Though only filled to 30% capacity, the return of spectators was a welcome sight to all fans of major American sports. The joy, however, was short lived as Pittsburgh got its revenge for last year’s Eastern Conference semifinal with a 3-1 victory. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Patient, Defensive Strategy Pays Dividends For Pittsburgh</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Coming into this game, it was well known Bob Lilley’s Pittsburgh team was going to be a tough team to break down. With one of the best defenses in the league last season - third in goals against and first in clean sheets - Pittsburgh is always a tough opponent to beat, even if they aren’t really beating you. With the possession-based system Louisville runs, they are one of the best equipped teams to break the Riverhounds down, but they are also one of the most vulnerable to counter attacks. Last season’s Eastern Conference champions disrupted Louisville’s possession play by pushing them wide and forcing crosses. With little aerial threat up front, Louisville looked lost when attacking for much of the game. Pittsburgh also caused trouble with their pressing. Bob Lilley’s side sat back for a lot of the match, but when they pressed high it was at just the right moments. Louisville loves to build out from the back, but their defenders didn’t look as comfortable in possession on Sunday. When pressured by Pittsburgh’s front three, Louisville not only failed to properly build from the back but committed errors that directly led to goals. The Riverhounds are going to be a tough team to beat this season, and their march towards the USL Cup opened in fantastic fashion.

      <h10><b>2. Defensive Errors Cost Louisville Chance to Open New Stadium With a Win</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It’s always going to be difficult to get a result when you concede three goals, but Louisville will be disappointed in themselves as all three goals could have been avoided. The least avoidable was the first goal, where right wingback Jordan Dover was able to beat Louisville’s offside trap and find himself unmarked in the box and finish easily to make it 1-1. The second goal came from sloppy passing in Louisville’s third forced by Pittsburgh’s excellent press. The Riverhounds easily regained possession and Louisville were unable to get enough pressure on former Michigan Wolverine Robbie Mertz as he finished off the second. The final goal was the worst example as some really poor decision making by centerback Jimmy Ockford led to the ball falling directly to the feet of Ropapa Mensah, who was forced wide but was able to cross the ball in for Anthony Velarde to finish. The good news for Louisville is that these errors are easily fixable, but it will hurt to not open the new stadium with a win.

      <h10><b>3. Pittsburgh Show Efficiency More Valuable In Attack Than Volume</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Louisville may have had more chances than Pittsburgh, but the Riverhounds certainly created better ones. I don’t have any xG numbers for USL, but I would imagine Pittsburgh won in this department. Thanks to Pittsburgh’s excellent defensive positioning, Louisville was forced to settle for long range shots - one of which actually went in - and crowded shots from wide. The Riverhounds, on the other hand, only had a handful of chances, but most were open shots from close in. Pittsburgh weren’t able to consistently get in great positions to shoot, but they did take advantage when the chances showed themselves. If Louisville are going to beat teams that defend like Pittsburgh, they are going to need to be less wasteful in front of goal.

      <h10><b>4. Louisville’s New Stadium a Big Deal For USL and American Soccer</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After an extra three month wait, Louisville City’s new Lynn Family Stadium finally hosted its first match. It’s a beautiful stadium with a giant video board and an open end where you can see the Louisville skyline in the distance. The stadium seats almost 12,000 people and is expandable to 15,000. If Louisville should decide to bid for an MLS expansion team, the stadium was designed to expand to as many as 20,000 seats to comply with MLS regulations. The stadium will also host Louisville’s new NWSL team, Racing Louisville FC, starting next season. This is a big deal for American soccer. If more teams are able to get their own soccer-specific stadium like this, especially in small markets like Louisville, it will only help accelerate the growth of the sport in this country. The ability to get more fans into games will drastically help smaller US clubs financially, and help boost the profile of American leagues overall - which is especially necessary with TV contract negotiations coming up.

      <h10><b>5. Fans Are Back In Attendance, But In Small Numbers</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although it was only 30% capacity, it was nice to see fans return to the stands for one of the five major American sports. With MLS, NWSL, NBA, and MLB all returning without fans, this is a big step forward in returning sports to normal as we move into the fall. The NFL and college football haven’t made concrete decisions on whether or not they will have fans, but partial capacity stadiums is something that both are looking at as possibilities for a fall return. The USL has a chance to blaze the trail for sports returning with fans, and all eyes should be on them to see how it could possibly be done.
