      After a dreadful trophyless 2018/19 season, Real Madrid have returned to their former status as one of the best soccer teams in Europe, securing their first La Liga title since 2017 as well as the Spanish Supercup. This fine form has to be attributed to the way Zidane has managed this team. In the past, Zidane was referred to as “lucky” by many due to his reliance on former striker Cristiano Ronaldo, but he has since proven that he is tactically astute and excellent man-manager in the absence of the Portuguese superstar. He has turned Real Madrid’s previously error-prone defense into the best in the world, conceding an average 0.66 goals per match and keeping 19 clean sheets in La Liga. His work in the transfer market has (for the most part) been a success, as signings such as Ferland Mendy and Rodrygo have been fantastic, and fit perfectly into the squad. Eden Hazard as well, despite being injured for much of the season, has shown flashes of brilliance similar to his performances at Chelsea.

            Now that their La Liga campaign is over, Real Madrid will now have to shift their focus to their main target (as it is every season): the Champions League. Real Madrid are historically the best club in this competition, having won the Champions League a record 13 times. This is because of Los Blancos’ incredibly consistent performances in knockout-style matches, where they can usually outclass their opponents due to superior squad talent over the 180-minute stretch. However, this time, Real Madrid do not have a superior squad than their opposition, Manchester City, who boast one of the most talented squads in the world. Since Real Madrid cannot rely on their talent and experience to win this match, they will have beat Manchester City tactically. This is especially tough as Manchester City have the best manager on the planet, Pep Guardiola (who has a special hatred for Real Madrid, as he is a former Barcelona academy product, player, and manager). Zidane will have to pull off a tactical masterclass to outsmart Guardiola.

    <h10><b>How Will They Line Up:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Real Madrid will be expected to line up in Zidane’s favored 4-3-3 formation, as he will not be looking to experiment in Champions League matches. Zidane usually selects experienced players over youth in big matches, so expect to see Luka Modric and Marcelo start over the in-form Fede Valverde and Ferland Mendy.
    </h13>
    <br></br>

          <h13>
            Real Madrid will have two players missing for the clash against Manchester City. The first is Mariano Diaz, who is out after contracting COVID-19. Mariano only made 5 appearances in La Liga this season, and I wouldn’t have expected him to make the squad list for this match anyway. The other player that will be absent for this match is the squad’s most important player: Sergio Ramos. The captain is serving a suspension after receiving a red card for a tackle made in the first leg. This will mean that rookie defender Eder Militao will slot into the center back spot, and he will have huge boots to fill. Ramos is the focal point of the team, his influence on the team is immense. He controls the backline, and it is quite apparent when he is absent (remember 1-4 vs. Ajax in 2019?). In the matches that he has been rested this season, Real Madrid’s defense has looked shaky even against the weakest teams in La Liga. If they aren’t at their very best against Manchester City, the boys from England will have a field day at the Etihad.
          </h13>

          <br></br>

          <h13>
            Zidane will look to use his three most experienced midfielders in Kroos, Casemiro, and Modric to try and retain possession and control the midfield against the Citizens. Kroos and Modric will use their excellent ability to pass the ball to move the Manchester City defense back and forth until they find the perfect pass to break them down. In defense, Kroos and Modric will try to keep Kevin De Bruyne from getting the ball, and Casemiro will be expected to man-mark him. If Zidane wants to add a bit more energy to his midfield or bring in another player to slow down City’s play, he can bring on Fede Valverde, who has the Kante-esque ability to run forever. He can be a useful asset if Zidane wants his team to press City’s backline, or if he wants to restrict the number of passes that Manchester City can play through the spine of their team.

    <h10><b>Player To Watch:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Eder Militao (Age: 22, Position: CB)</b><h12>
      <br></br>
    <h13>
      Real Madrid brought in Militao in the summer of 2019 from Porto, and so far his tenure in the Spanish capital has been promising. Militao has made 10 starts for Los Blancos in La Liga this season and kept clean sheets in 5 of those matches. He hasn’t featured in any huge matches this season, with his biggest match being the 1-0 win over Getafe after the restart. The match against Manchester City will be a huge test for the young Brazilian, as he will have to put in a near-perfect performance to keep the Citizens from scoring. One promising aspect of Militao’s game is his ability to win the ball in the air, as he boasts the highest percentage of aerial duels won in La Liga (79.6%), which will come in handy when defending crosses from Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva and all of City’s other attackers.
    </h13>
    <img src="../blog-img/champions-league-preview-real-madrid/champions-league-preview-real-madrid-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:70%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:40px;">
    <h10><b>Prediction: Semifinal</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Madrid are in great form right now, having gone undefeated in their 11 matches since the restart. Los Blancos have also had 3 weeks to rest and prepare for their Champions League matchup, as opposed to City’s two-week break. These two reasons, as well as Real Madrid’s past performances in knockout style play, give me hope that they can turn around this matchup. I believe that in a match marred with controversy and drama, Real Madrid will beat Manchester City to keep their Champions League hopes alive. From there on, I expect them to beat either Juventus or Lyon (wouldn’t it be great to see Ronaldo vs. Real Madrid?), and lose in the semifinals to the eventual champions, Bayern Munich.
    </h13>
