      <h12><b>Final Score: Barcelona 4-0 Villarreal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Barcelona opened their La Liga campaign with a huge win over a lackluster Villarreal team. Here are my five key takeaways:
      </h13>

  <!-- 1st Row -------------------------------------------------->
  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>1. This Barcelona Side Is Dangerous</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Coming into this match, I had no idea what to expect out of Barcelona. I certainly didn’t think that they’d put in four goals in the first half against a talented Villarreal side. Coutinho and Griezmann looked to be back to their creative bests, after poor showings last season, and Ansu Fati was brilliant in attack all throughout the first half. Messi, while his demeanor was different throughout the match, was his usual excellent self on the ball. This Barcelona squad still has one of the most talented attacks in the world, and it will surely propel this team into challenging for the La Liga title.
      </h13>

  <!-- 2nd Row -------------------------------------------------->
  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>2. Ansu Fati Is A Real Star</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After his breakout 2019/2020 season where he scored 7 La Liga goals in 24 appearances, expectations were high for Ansu Fati this season. It’s fair to assume that he’ll live up to these expectations, as he opened his 2020/2021 La Liga account on the first matchday with 2 goals in the opening 20 minutes. He also drew the penalty that earned Barcelona their third goal, by using his pace to draw Villarreal’s Mario Gaspar into making a poor challenge in the penalty area. He was undoubtedly the man of the match against Villarreal, and he was by far the best player on the pitch. His combination of pace, ball control, and football IQ are lethal, and he will be a key player for Barcelona this season.

  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>3. Villarreal Failed To Show Up</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Villarreal were disastrous against Barcelona, conceding 4 goals in the first half. Their midfield (which was led by the newcomers Parejo and Coquelin) was torn apart on multiple occasions by Barcelona, and this left their backline incredibly vulnerable to a hungry Barcelona attack. The backline themselves were also poor, as Mario Gaspar conceded a poor penalty, and center back Pau Torres misplaced a Messi cross that ended up with the ball in his own net. Goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo kept Villarreal in the game, making numerous big saves to keep the scoreline from really getting out of hand (however, not even he was exempt from blame, as he probably should have saved Messi’s penalty).
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Going into this season, I expected Villarreal to challenge for a Champions League spot, as they bolstered their already talented squad well over the summer. However, after their first 3 matches (where they drew with newly-promoted Huesca, beat Eibar, and lost to Barcelona) I don’t think they’re performing at the level needed to challenge for a top-four position. Their attack and defense look fine, but their midfield needs work. I assume it will take time for Parejo and Coquelin to mesh with the squad, and I know it takes time to adjust to Unai Emery’s tactics and strategies, but with how condensed this season is, their issues need to be sorted out quickly or else they may end up looking like Real Betis from last season: a talented team that just can’t pick up 3 points consistently (Betis finished 15th in the table).

  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. Lionel Messi Seems Different</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I am not saying Messi played poorly. In fact, he played very well, grabbing a penalty goal and forcing Pau Torres’ own goal. Messi seems different in his attitude and mannerisms, however. I don’t remember seeing him make any pressures in the match against Villarreal, and in addition, he almost never tracked back to defend. He seems willing to go about his attacking duties, but it doesn’t look like he wants to exert himself more than he has to. This could very well be part of Koeman’s system, but it would seem more probable that he would want Antoine Griezmann to remain up top, as he is the squad’s striker.
      </h13>

  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>5. Luis Suarez Would Not Fit Koeman’s Barcelona</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As is mentioned in the last section, Griezmann did not just play as a striker against Villarreal. Instead, he tracked back whenever Barcelona was in defense, even going as far as Barcelona’s own penalty area, something we didn’t even see him do at Atletico Madrid. While Luis Suarez is an excellent attacker and finisher, I don’t think that he would have been willing to put in that much effort on defense, especially since he is 33 years old. We will have to wait and see if Koeman continues to expect his striker to be active in defense, but if he does, it will explain why Luis Suarez was forced out of the club.
