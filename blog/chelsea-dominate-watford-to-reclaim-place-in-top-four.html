      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Following a lackluster midweek performance at West Ham United, Chelsea rebounded with a convincing win at Stamford Bridge over Watford. Goals from Olivier Giroud, Willian, and Ross Barkley proved to be the difference. Here are five key takeaways.

            Christian Pulisic has been a revelation since the restart, and he once again showed his class and work rate on Saturday. The American created many of Chelsea’s best chances in the first half and was hunting for a goal for much of the second half. He supplied two great balls that Olivier Giroud was unable to finish and drew a penalty that was later converted by Willian in the first 45. Frank Lampard left his winger in for the entire match, and Pulisic rewarded his manager with consistent pressure on the Watford defense and many good looks for goal. Although Ross Barkley bagged a goal and an assist, it was Pulisic who led the Chelsea attack for much of the day. More performances like this will leave Lampard with no choice but to start the American alongside new arrivals Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech in the Chelsea attack next season.

      <h10><b>2. Watford Doomed by a One-Dimensional Attack</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Aside from a few late attacks, Watford almost exclusively attacked on the left side of the pitch through combination play between Will Hughes and Nathaniel Chalobah. Striker Troy Deeney had no real chances before being subbed off and Ismaïla Sarr was tragically underutilized on the right side of the attack. This decision allowed César Azpilicueta to push up the left side in support of Christian Pulisic and Ross Barkley, and the left-back was able to make key passes in the final third and secure an assist on Barkley’s late goal. A confident performance by Chelsea’s young right-back Reece James was the final blow in Watford’s failed attempt to control the game on the left flank.

              Olivier Giroud has started three of Chelsea’s five games since the restart, and the Blues have won all three of these matches. His clinical finish in the first half gave Chelsea the lead and he continued to threaten the Watford backline by making timely runs into the box and flying high to head many threatening crosses. Giroud has only scored four goals in the Premier League this season, but he has been given far fewer chances than Tammy Abraham. Although he lacks the pace many expect from top-flight strikers, Giroud’s ability in the air, hold up play, and tactical awareness still make him a viable option. Timo Werner is expected to start at striker for Chelsea next year, but Frank Lampard can confidently turn to Giroud as his side continues to fight for Champions League qualification.

            <h10><b>4. Watford Fails to Inspire Despite Threat of Relegation</b></h10>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Nigel Pearson’s side traveled to London sitting just one point clear of relegation, and they will return north in the same position. The Hornets showed little to know drive to pressure Chelsea despite the fact that they are at risk of playing in the Championship next season. With only 30% of possession and three shots on target, Watford failed to give Chelsea any real problems on Saturday. By refusing to put any real pressure on Chelsea in the first 30 minutes, the Watford squad left themselves open to attack and their opponents took full advantage of their lack of intensity. Sloppy play from Etienne Capoue gifted Chelsea a penalty which doubled the lead, and the Blues never looked back. Watford did increase the intensity in the final 15 minutes and had a couple of real chances, but easy saves by Kepa Arizzabalaga signified that it was too little too late.

      <h10><b>5. Consistency the Key for Chelsea</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If you told Chelsea fans in August that their side would be in the top four with five matches to play, many would have jumped for joy. After the departure of Eden Hazard, the appointment of a new manager, and a transfer ban, Blues fans around the world were certain the side would struggle to compete with the other giants in the league. Frank Lampard’s side has been incredibly impressive and has certainly exceeded expectations, but performances like the one we saw against West Ham leave everyone wondering - where is the consistency? When this side performs to its full potential, it can compete with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City. Saturday’s dominance over the full 90 minutes shows that Chelsea fans are right to think that their side can compete for the title in upcoming seasons, but Frank Lampard needs his players to finish strong to ensure a spot in the Champions League next season and prove they are an elite side. Between steady play in the back, clinical passing in the midfield, and creative play from forwards, Chelsea put together of its best performances of the season against Watford. If this Chelsea squad can play like that for the rest of the way, they will not only clinch a spot in the Champions League, they just might win the FA Cup and set themselves up for an interesting run next season.
