        Since the news that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had coronavirus broke in March, the FA had to deal with a whirlwind of uncertainty. From suspending the next league match, Arsenal vs Manchester City, to deciding to suspend the entire league, it has been just short of 100 days since Leicester City beat Aston Villa 4-0 in the King Power Stadium - a match that appeared to possibly be the final game of the 2019/20 Premier League season.

        With the FA agreeing on June 17 as the startup date for the rest of the season, the four teams with a game in hand are playing on this first matchday leading into a weekend chock-full of matches. The games on June 17 include Aston Villa vs Sheffield United and the Arsenal vs Manchester City match at the Etihad that was supposed to be the next match in line so many weeks ago. With so many storylines to pick up from this ‘Big 6’ match we will start with the lineups.

        <b><u>Arsenal Lineup Prediction</u></b>
      </h11>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It seems like so long ago that Manchester City dismantled Arsenal at the Emirates in December. One of the key figures in this dominant 3-0 win for City was assistant manager Mikel Arteta. With Arteta now on the other side of the game, it will be interesting to see how he will approach this match with Arsenal as he knows how Manchester City will look to exploit his defence. With that being said let's look at who Arteta will be looking to start.

        <i>Defense</i>
      </h11>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        At goalkeeper is probably the easiest decision to be made in these predictions. Emiliano Martinez has been great in the games he has played, but there has been no reason to consider putting Bernd Leno on the bench. Ranked second in number of saves this Premier League campaign, Bernd Leno is arguably Arsenal’s player of the season with the only competition being in the star man Aubameyang

              At center back there are a few more question marks. Sokratis and Holding are options, but Sokratis has not been a man in favor under Arteta, only making appearances out of position at right back. Meanwhile Rob Holding has not looked like the same player of yesteryear after suffering a ruptured ACL. This leaves three options as the most likely to be chosen by Arteta: David Luiz, Shkodran Mustafi and Pablo Mari. Pablo Mari made his first Premier League start in the game before the break in play. Although he did well, and although I would not be shocked to see the former Manchester City player end up starting the game, it would be a baptism by fire of sorts. This leaves my two predicted starters for the match. The most obvious of the choices is David Luiz, who’s play style is in line with what Arteta wants Arsenal to do going forward. My other choice is the much-hated player in Mustafi, who, to be fair, has been reinvigorated under Mikel Arteta and has had a couple performances in the last couple of months that fall in line with his now inexplicable price tag.

      <h13>
        Outside-back also provides a little bit of competition. Right back is probably a write-in with Hector Bellerin. Although Sokratis started at right back in the most recent Premier League match, Bellerin is the first-choice and was probably only left on the bench as a result of trying to keep him fresh for future matches. The other two options in Maitland-Niles and Cedric are certainly doubts as in the most recent friendlies Maitland-Niles has been playing as a center mid and Cedric is clearly not a favored player. Left back may be the most difficult decision in the Arsenal team as this decision could shape who plays moving forward. Kolasinac does not seem like a player that would be making an appearance in this match due to the other two options in the position. Bukoyo Saka was the star man in the games leading into the long break, but as his contract is running down, it seems Arteta may try to play him further forward as much as possible. This leads me to believe that Arteta will start Tierney, the summer signing who has struggled with injuries, and a player who Arteta has talked very highly of since he has arrived as the coach.

            <h13>For the two pivot spots in the 4-2-3-1, Mikel Arteta has been fairly consistent over the last few games giving those positions to Granit Xhaka and Dani Ceballos. There are concerns with these choices for the upcoming game. First, Granit Xhaka has only managed to play one half of football over the friendlies against lower level sides. Even with this in mind, if Xhaka is healthy enough to play I am fairly confident Mikel Arteta will start him in this match. Now as far as Dani Ceballos goes, he has seemed to be coming into his own in recent games under Mikel Arteta, but his attack minded playstyle that makes him so desirable against lower sides may lead Arteta to choose a more defensive option. That defensive option would normally be Lucas Torreira, but as he will be missing the first match due to injury, this leads to the idea that Matteo Guendouzi may find his way into the starting lineup. Do not write off the idea that the forgotten man in Ainsley Maitland-Niles may find his way into the lineup as he has been playing midfield in friendlies, but I believe the starters in these positions will be Guendouzi and Xhaka.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As far as the attacking midfielder spot goes, there aren’t many options. Joe Willock has been playing well in the friendlies, scoring a goal in each match, and has seemingly been impressing Mikel Arteta. Although former managers were very reluctant to play Mesut Ozïl in away matches, it seems that Arteta has been very willing to start Ozïl for all matches and then bring Willock on mid-match leading me to believe this match will be no different.

            <h11><i>Forwards</i></h11>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Now we are on to an area that is packed full of talent and players that would love minutes. Starting out left, there are a couple options. This year we have seen Saka and Martinelli make a splash playing for Arsenal, and it seems that both of their preferred positions are out on the left flank. However, top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has played out left in all the Arsenal games in the Premier League for Arteta. There is nothing to suggest that this match will be any different, and Aubameyang will likely be playing in that spot once again. Now the right side is a little bit more of a question mark. Although Nicolas Pepe has started the last couple of matches on the right side with much success, his defensive flaws makes me believe that Arteta will be looking for more shape against a destructive Manchester City side. There is still the option of Martinelli and Saka as they could play on both sides of the field, but in the end, I believe many forget that at the start of Mikel Arteta’s reign, when he wanted structure, his go-to player was Reiss Nelson. Nelson had been struggling with injury when Pepe found his run of form, but in this situation he may find himself back in the starting lineup for this match.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Finally for the position of striker, if Aubameyang is not playing out left he will certainly be playing up top, but due to the idea he will probably play out left, that leaves Lacazette and Nketiah. Lacazette is the more experienced, successful of the two players, but in the games leading up to the break Nketiah seemed to be starting. Nketiah’s run in the team had begun to extend past a wakeup call for Lacazette and started being his spot. Even with this being said, I believe Arteta will start Lacazette as he provides energy and positioning that is hard to ignore for a game against Manchester City.

      </h11>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        This match is going to be an interesting opportunity to see what the masterful Pep Guardiola chooses to do against his former apprentice. Will he stick to what he knows can beat Arsenal or will he use what Arteta knows about the inner workings of Manchester City against him?

      </h11>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a team full of talent, defence has been Manchester City’s biggest weakness by far. The injuries and inconsistencies in the back have definitely been the difference between City’s past record-breaking seasons and falling far behind the seemingly unstoppable Reds of Liverpool. Goalkeeper is once again a very simple choice. Ederson is certainly a write in, even if he has had a very lackluster season highlighted by the two goals he allowed against Manchester United in City’s match before the break in play.

            <h13>
              Center back is a position that has been ravaged by injuries and bad performances all year. The first choice center back is certainly Aymeric Laporte, who has been one of the league’s best defenders the past couple of years. It is difficult not to imagine how City’s season would have differed if he had stayed healthy for the season, but he is back now, and bound to start against the Gunners. The other center back position is more of a tossup as the options have been struggling with injuries and poor performances. The three options that have a chance are Otamendi, Stones, and Fernandinho. I would like to think with his poor performances all season Otamendi would not be making an appearance against Arsenal. The decision between Stones and Fernandinho is a tough one, Stones is a natural center back that has had some very good games in a City shirt. The issue is that he is inconsistent at times. Keeping that in mind with the knowledge that it is rare to see the 35-year-old Fernandinho on the bench of a Pep team leads me to believe that the Brazilian will be the other starting center back.

        Outside-back is a tale of two sides. The outside-back position is one that has been transformed over the past couple of years. It is now a position that relies on offensive prowess and peak physical fitness. The left side has struggled to have both of those traits for City while the right side has an overabundance of both qualities. On the left side if Benjamin Mendy can stay in peak physical fitness, then he is the first choice. I believe that this break would have done him quite a bit of good, finding himself in the starting lineup over Zinchenko. On the other side there are two quality right backs in Kyle Walker and Joao Cancelo. I could very easily see Pep picking either player, but it did seem as if leading into the break Cancelo was showing that he actually could play in the Premier League leading me to believe he will be the starting right back.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a 4-3-3 the midfield is a very crucial part, allowing the offensive three the opportunity to attack. It seems like the defensive midfielder in this midfield three chooses himself. Rodri has had an up and down year, but was seemingly in his longest up of the year right before the break. Although there is the possibility of Fernandinho moving back into his old defensive midfield position and Gündoğan can also play that position with some success, Rodri is definitely the favorite to be starting.

            <h13>Now for the two more attacking midfielders in this 4-3-3 there are a couple players to keep in mind. Kevin De Bruyne is one of the best players the world and will almost certainly find his name in the starting eleven vs Arsenal. The other attacking midfield position is a little more in the air as there are the likes of Bernardo, David Silva, Foden, and Gündoğan. David Silva has not even played in 3 of the last 4 matches leading me to believe he will not be in the starting lineup. Gündoğan is a quality player, but does not seem like someone who would be getting game time over Bernardo and Foden. Foden is a world talent, but I think Guardiola and Foden will both know with the five substitutions rule in place and an overabundance of games in a short span of time, Foden will get the play time he desires. This leads me to believe that Bernardo will be the final midfield player in the three that Guardiola puts forward.

            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The selections I have chosen in the midfield have left less options in the attacking front. The left wing position could be one of two players when everyone is healthy. What has been said from Leroy Sane is that he is trying not to rush a return to football, and he would like to make a couple more appearances before he begins starting at a high level. That leaves the world-class Raheem Sterling as the starter on the left wing. With Bernardo Silva in the starting midfielder that leaves limited options on the right wing. Phil Foden can certainly do a job on that right wing, but the expansive Riyad Mahrez will fit perfectly into this match, as Guardiola has shown confidence in him this season.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              For the final position of striker there are only two options available. Both are very desirable players. Gabriel Jesus is a talent that has proven himself time and time again and is a force to reckon with. This does not make it any less likely that Sergio Aguero will start this match. Aguero has an excellent track record against Arsenal with 11 goals in 16 matches, and with a large break for him to get to full fitness, he is a sight that Arsenal should fear to see coming at their goal.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There is clearly a team with more quality in it with Manchester City. With that being said, Arsenal is the only unbeaten team in 2020 within the Premier League as Mikel Arteta has seemed to turn his team into a formidable force on defense. Even with these improvements, and the knowledge Arteta holds of Manchester City’s inner workings, this match holds the feeling of a classic Arsenal performance against big six opponents over the past couple of years. They will score a goal fairly early or possibly an equalizer leading the viewers to believe they are in for a good game. This will lead to a domination by City in the final 60 minutes of the game tearing Arsenal apart.
