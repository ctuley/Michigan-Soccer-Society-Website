      Asif Kapadia’s HBO documentary Diego Maradona tracks the Argentine superstar’s rise and fall during his time with Napoli from the mid-eighties to the early nineties. As in his previous films - like the 2016 Oscar-winning Amy - Kapadia doesn’t use talking heads to tell us what happened and instead lets the footage tell the story itself. This makes it extremely effective for soccer fans and non-fans alike. By taking the footage for what it is, and not having someone interpret it for the audience, the viewer is able to better understand Maradona’s brilliance and importance because they see all the fantastic dribbles, the precise finishes, and most importantly the reactions from the people of Naples.

            The Napoli supporters tie the whole film together by being important factors in each storyline that the documentary tracks. One storyline and the one most people will be familiar with, is the rise and fall of Diego Maradona as a sports hero. Perhaps “hero” is actually a bit of an understatement - god might be more apt. And as many scenes show us, the Church of Maradona was alive and well in Naples during this time. From the massive celebrations after winning a trophy, to the mobs of people that show up seemingly every time Maradona steps outside, the film makes it very clear how crazy this city was for him. Plenty of sequences show how the rest of Italy feels about this region of the country - how they abuse and discriminate against the people of this city to make them feel less than human - but Maradona gives them hope. By elevating the club to heights never before reached, the people of Naples seem to find a new sense of pride in themselves and where they are from. Maradona pushed them to the top, and the city pushed him to the top.

            What truly elevates Diego Maradona above your typical sports documentary is its second storyline and the way the two are intertwined. The other half of the documentary is a more personal examination of Maradona himself and the ways fame pushed him to the edge, ultimately leading to his falling out with the Italian club and its fans. The two storylines are almost looking at two entirely different people, and that plays into one of the main ideas of the movie: the idea of using a facade to hide your true self and the dangers that can come with that. The film paints very different portraits of the loud, public “Maradona” and the quiet, troubled “Diego”. The fans play a large part in driving Diego away and having Maradona almost completely takeover. When he is constantly in the public eye, his public persona starts to become his main persona. While this is the Maradona that most of us are familiar with, it is important that the film has that balance to actually give the audience a deeper insight into who this man is. Watching his struggles with substance abuse is made more powerful when juxtaposed with his successes and the public part of his life taking over the private part.

      It doesn’t quite reach the levels of the all-time great sports documentaries like OJ: Made In America or Hoop Dreams, but it does do the thing that makes those films so great. It doesn’t focus on sports and instead uses it as a means to explore deeper themes - in this case fame, identity, and addiction. The film is at its best when it’s breaking down the myth of Diego Maradona instead of relying on the viewer’s nostalgia for the player. It lets the audience come to its own conclusions about Maradona instead of telling them how to feel about him. All of these things make it a great documentary even for people unfamiliar with the subject.
