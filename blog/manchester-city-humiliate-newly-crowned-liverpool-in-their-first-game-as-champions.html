      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester City 4 - 0 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was off to the races at the Etihad as both teams brought the intensity and pressure in the first 25 minutes of play. Momentum was in Liverpool’s hands until an unfortunate foul from Joe Gomez granted Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne the opportunity to put his team up 1-0. Once they led, City continued to dismantle Liverpool’s backline with counterattack after a counterattack, resulting in a massive victory for the Manchester club. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

      <h10><b>1. Phil Foden Proves His Worth</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With David Silva leaving Manchester City after this season, 20-year-old Phil Foden has some massive shoes to fill. Receiving nothing but praise from his manager Pep Guardiola, Foden has drawn a lot of attention as to whether he will be able to live up to all the expectations set for him, or if he will take more time to develop. Against one of the top defenses in the world, Foden showed his talent for opening up the pitch and creating chances for both himself and his fellow teammates. Picking up an assist and a goal, the 20-year-old Englishman found himself involved in nearly every attack, decimating Liverpool’s world-class defense. Losing the likes of David Silva and Leroy Sane, Manchester City are lucky to have a young lad like Foden who looks ready to step into the starting lineup and make a run at the title next year.

      <h10><b>2. Liverpool Look Less Focused Without a Title to Play for</b></h10>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Having won the league and already been knocked out of the Champions League and FA Cup, it seems as though Liverpool has little to play for in the rest of their season. Coming off a week of celebration to a match against one of their toughest opponents, a loss today could have easily been excused, but not the 4-0 battering that they endured. After coming out guns blazing and forcing mistakes by City’s backline, Liverpool’s whole game plan seemed to fall apart after Raheem Sterling won Manchester City a penalty. Sloppy passing and a failure to produce chances resulted in Liverpool playing the rest of the game on their heels, something that the Premier League champions have not experienced often this season. Maybe it is just one game, but if Liverpool hopes to break more records this season, they need to continue to bring the class and quality that we saw before the title was clinched.

      <h10><b>3. Both Teams Could Look to Improve Their Defense Before Next Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester City’s backline has been volatile all season, with manager Pep Guardiola shuffling his players through the lineup very frequently. French national Aymeric Laporte has proven himself a strong candidate for future seasons, but their other center back spot is up in the air at the current moment. With Nicolas Otamendi likely to transfer after this season and Fernandinho having turned 35 earlier this summer, manager Pep Guardiola is left with options of John Stones and Eric Garcia, neither of which have proved themselves ready for the spot quite yet. Pep Guardiola will likely look elsewhere for a new center half to send out with Laporte. As for Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool, Joe Gomez has found himself being the supporting center back to Virgil Van Dijk following injury problems with former starter Joel Matip. While Matip has yet to show much reason to doubt his ability, this game against City showed many weaknesses in Gomez’s play. With rumors of a transfer with Napoli for defender Kalidou Koulibaly for both clubs, it will be interesting to see who can land the big center-back and how that will improve their squads for next season.

      <h10><b>4. Kevin De Bruyne Shows Why He’s the Best Midfielder in the World</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When it comes to creative playmakers, those of the quality of Kevin De Bruyne are few and far between. Recording his 17th assist and 11th goal of the season, De Bruyne put on a masterclass against Liverpool. His ability to pick out even the tightest of passes with ease sets him apart from his peers and is reminiscent of Andres Iniesta in his prime at Barcelona. With six games remaining, De Bruyne sits only 3 assists behind Thierry Henry’s record of 20 assists in a season and looks poised to overtake it himself. As Man City looks forward to making a run at the Premier League title again next season, Kevin De Bruyne is sure to be their most valuable player as he looks to cement himself as one of the greatest midfielders in Premier League history.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With Manchester United on a 15 game unbeaten run and Chelsea looking stronger than ever with talented transfers incoming, the Premier League should be home to a four-way battle for the title. City’s win over Liverpool today sent a message to the current champions that it will not be so easy next season, and showed that they have the talent to win their third title in four years. Even outside of these four massive clubs, current third-place Leicester and the ever-improving Wolves could also make a run at the title, and at the very least create roadblocks that will test the top teams on their quest for the Premier League trophy. As these teams fight for their chance at European football next season, we will get a good glimpse in the coming weeks at what to expect from the top clubs next year. Will Liverpool and City rise to the top again, or will we see a breakout season from the likes of Chelsea or United?
