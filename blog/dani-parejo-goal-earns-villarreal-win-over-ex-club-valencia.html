    <h12><b>Final Score: Villarreal 2-1 Valencia</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      A penalty from Paco Alcacer and a goal from Dani Parejo were enough to see Villarreal top Valencia and move into La Liga’s top spot. Here are my five key takeaways:

            Up until this match, Villarreal had only had two different players score this season: Paco Alcacer and Gerard Moreno. When it was announced that Moreno would be out for a month after sustaining a knee injury last week, I was skeptical how Villarreal would hold up without him. It turns out, they did fine. Paco Alcacer bagged a penalty in the 6th minute, and Dani Parejo grabbed a winner in the 69th to seal a pretty simple victory for the Yellow Submarine.

    <h10><b>2. Dani Parejo Grabs A Goal Against His Old Club</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I was interested in seeing how Dani Parejo would do against the club that he played for for the last 9 years, and he didn’t disappoint. Partnering Manu Trigueros in a central midfield role, he helped Villarreal control the tempo of the match (especially in the first half) and keep Valencia on the back foot. He eventually scored the match-winner in the 69th minute, after his shot from the top of the box took a deflection off of Moussa Diakhaby and bounced in off of the crossbar. At first, he made off as if to celebrate the great goal, but then caught himself, and refused to celebrate out of respect to his former side.

    <h10><b>3. Geoffrey Kondogbia Dropped From The Valencia Squad</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After the comments that Kondogbia made on Instagram this week about how club president Anil Murthy had “destroyed” the club, the Central African Republic international was not featured in the squad to face Villarreal. Without their best midfielder, Valencia looked out of sorts, and there was a large gap in front of Los Che’ backline. Stand-in midfielders Carlos Soler and Daniel Wass are both quality players, but neither of them has the same play style or positional awareness (as they don’t play the same position) that Kondogbia has. I’m interested to see if Kondogbia will ever play for Valencia again, or if he will look to exit the club in the winter transfer window. Either way, Valencia will suffer greatly without him, they are already low on high-quality midfielders after losing Parejo and Francis Coquelin in the summer.

    <h10><b>4. It’s Good To See Valencia Have Some Fight Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      This is not a knock on Valencia, I understand they’ve had some really tough times this year. However, this match was a bright spot despite their loss to Villarreal. The team showed some serious fight and a real desire to win. In the end, it wasn’t enough, but you could see that each player really gave it their all. Hopefully, they can keep their spirits and fight up, to continue playing at the best level possible. I don’t believe that European football is achievable for them this season, but it’s still very early on, and I wouldn’t put it past Javi Gracia to turn this team into a quality side that can go toe-to-toe with the biggest teams in La Liga.

          Unai Emery brought on Japanese wonderkid Take Kubo in the 64th minute of this match to try and see if he could use his excellent technical abilities to help Villarreal find a winner. They eventually did, but Kubo had a match to forget. In the 72nd minute, the Real Madrid loanee was shown a yellow card for a high-boot challenge, and in the 92nd, he was shown his second yellow for a lunging challenge that was deemed too rough by the referee. Fortunately for Villarreal, there were only 3 minutes left in the match, and they could see out the match easily with only 10 men. This was Kubo’s first-ever career sending-off, and he will hope it never happens again, especially in a big match such as this one.
