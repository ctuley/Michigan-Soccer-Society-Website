      <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool 2 - 1 Tottenham Hotspur </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Liverpool vs Tottenham Hotspur is not a game that screams ‘title decider’ and while, in this topsy-turvy season, it definitely was not a decider, it was one that brought a little more clarity to this mad dog race that is the English Premier League. The scoreline does not do justice to just how exciting this night was for the 2,000 fans sitting in Anfield as well as the millions watching from home. Perhaps no statement better epitomises the importance of this game’s outcome than the one made by Peter Drury as Andy Robertson prepared to take a corner-kick at the cusp of full time. “The 90th minute, for the leadership of the league, going into the last weekend before Christmas. Spurs have it on goal difference right now,” he said and the rest, as they say, is history.

      <h10><b>1. One For The Purists</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With the large influx of ex-pros taking on jobs at their old clubs, not many of Europe’s elite can claim to have a tactical genius in the dressing room. This matchup, however, was as tactical a game as we have seen all season, coming from the minds of two of the best the game has to offer. Both managers stuck to their guns and while nothing we saw was outside the bounds of expectations, it was fascinating to witness. Spurs in particular went above and beyond with the gritty, stubborn performances we have become accustomed to, recording the second fewest passes ever made by a Mourinho side in the first half of a game. The build up to that agonising Steven Bergwijn miss on the 63rd minute was almost a picture perfect manifestation of the Portugese’s vision as the Dutch international latched onto a Son header who in turn received a header from Kane who in turn rose to meet a long ball from Hugo Lloris. In the end, there was an overwhelming sense of relief amongst many fans who were dreading another victory for Mourinho’s ‘negative’ football. Moreover, as man-management supposedly becomes the name of the game, it was pleasing to see two managers implement their philosophies and execute them perfectly… well, almost perfectly.

      <h10><b>2. Fortress With A Capital ‘F’</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Coming into this match, the red half of Merseyside had not seen their team lose at home for 65 games now. You can go back as far as you want, but every team that has dominated the English game has boasted a spectacular home record that not only demoralised, but also intimidated any visiting team. It has been well documented that in the 30 year gap between their 18th and 19th league title, Anfield completely lost its fear factor. Last night, however, even with a meagre 3.75% of the stadium filled, the fans got through to their team who were in turn able to find something within themselves to push until the very end and turn one point into three. Even with significant injuries in their defense and an in form Spurs team as their opposition, Liverpool managed to maintain their impressive home record and in a season such as this one, despite all their injuries, that might just be enough to push them over the line. Nevertheless, the Anfield faithful will be having some sleepless nights in the buildup to their next home game because the last team to beat them at Anfield was Sam Allardyce’s Crystal Palace in 2017. Their next home fixture is, you guessed it, Sam Allardyce’s West Bromwich Albion. Be scared Liverpool, be very very scared.

      <h10><b>3. Curtis Jones’ Coming Of Age</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both teams fielded many of their regular starters and star men, but it takes some real quality to stand out in a game as high pressure as this one. Enter Curtis Jones. With Alexander-Arnold being the only real homegrown player Klopp has integrated into the first team set up, Curtis Jones presents a brilliant opportunity for the German not only to improve his record of blooding in talent from the academy, but to also to sure up an injury-hit midfield. The 19-year-old proved his worth to the team by putting in an energetic, disciplined and nearly faultless performance in the center of the park, an area of the pitch that Liverpool dominated from start to finish. He also played a crucial role in the buildup to Mo Salah’s goal, carrying the ball into the box before it broke for the Egyptian. Nothing pleases the Anfield faithful, or any fanbase for that matter, more than a homegrown player making it big and Liverpool fans will be desperate to see him succeed. Neither is he one for the headlines, nor is he a typical showbiz player, he’s just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dreams will, one day, hopefully, come true...

      <h10><b>4. Did The Best Team Lose?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Jose Mourinho is not one to mince his words, and he had them in abundance after the final whistle on Wednesday evening. His Spurs team, who lost for the first time since the opening weekend, ended the game with a higher xG than their opposition. That, however, is not necessarily a reflection of them being the better team, instead, simply a reflection of the big and high quality chances the Lilywhites squandered. Considering the two manager’s gameplans, it is actually an interesting debate. How does one decide who the best team was in a game? On some occasions it’s just obvious, but what about games like last night? Is it the team that had more of the ball, hence, potentially controlled the pace of the game better? Jose might argue the pace of the game can be handled equally as well without the ball. Is it the team that created the most clear cut chances because that award would, as the xG suggests, have to go to the men from London. Or is it simply, after all is said and done, the team that wins? Certainly, if Jose was on the winning side, he might have agreed with that sentiment.

      <h10><b>5. Title Aspirations</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Considering the nature of this premier league season, it would be unwise to make any bold predictions about how it will end even as we approach the new year. However, it is safe to assume that Liverpool and Tottenham are two teams that consider themselves to be in the title mix, regardless of the Special One’s affection for ponies. Come the end of this season, we might look back to this game and Bobby Firmino’s 90th minute winner as a pivotal moment in the race for the English Premier League. Jurgen Klopp has created a monster of a system that seems to be thriving even without some of its most essential cogs while Jose Mourinho seems to be back to at least a version of his former, charismatic and iconic self. Both managers have domestic league pedigree, maybe one more so than the other which is, however, balanced out by the history of both clubs in the competition. Liverpool may be gunning for their 20th title and Spurs for only their first, but the hunger of both teams and managers is unlikely to be satisfied anytime soon. The other London clubs, Manchester clubs and maybe even a few of the smaller names might have their say in it as the season progresses, but I can say one thing with absolute certainty: Arsenal Football Club will play no part in the title race whatsoever.
