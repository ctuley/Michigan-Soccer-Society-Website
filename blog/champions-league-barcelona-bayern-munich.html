      <h10>Bayern Trample Barcelona’s Champions League Hopes in 8-2 Battering</h10>

      <h12><b>Final Score: Bayern Munich 8 - 2 Barcelona</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Lisbon was home to a 90 minute beatdown tonight as Bayern breezed past Barcelona into the Champions League semifinals. An early goal for each side promised a tight affair until Bayern blew the lid off the game, scoring three goals in nine minutes. Barcelona pulled one back early in the second half, only for Bayern to pile on four more before the final whistle saved Barcelona’s exhausted backline from further humiliation. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Bayern May Just Be Unstoppable</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If there was any question as to who was the best team in Europe coming into this match, they were certainly answered by the end of the 90 minutes. Having suffered zero losses and only one draw since January, Hansi Flick has created a well-oiled machine, drilled in pressing high and prolific scoring. Their win over Barcelona today extended their Champions League record to
        9-0, a mark that few other teams, if any, have been able to achieve. As they look forward to their semifinal matchup against either Manchester City or Lyon, it seems as though the outcome may already be decided. Hungry for their first treble since 2013, it will take a massive effort from any other club to stop Bayern in their current form.

      <h10><b>2. Barcelona Sack Manager Quique Setien Just Hours After Loss</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Following their brutal loss tonight, Barcelona announced that manager Quique Setien will not return to coach their squad next season. This comes just months after his signing for the club, having joined in January after the ousting of former manager Ernesto Valverde. Their 2019-20 season marks the first since 2007-08 that they have failed to win a single trophy. With many aging players, including Leo Messi, Barcelona seems to be heading down the same path as AC Milan in the early 2010s. Many fans have been calling for an overhaul in the organization, rallying for the replacement of nearly all of the club’s board. The upcoming weeks will be exciting to watch how the Barcelona squad will fill Setien’s job and whether or not they will make any young signings to replace their ever-aging players.

      <h10><b>3. This Season Marks First UCL Semifinal Without Messi Or Ronaldo In 15 Years</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite only allowing one goal in the game, Arsenal’s back line continues to be their weakest point. Allowing 24 shots, 8 of which were on target, the Gunners found themselves a bit lucky to finish the game only allowing Mane’s early goal. Bernd Leno’s backup Emiliano Martinez proved he can hold his own, garnering half a dozen saves and providing solid distribution from the back. 23 year old Kieran Tierney also had a solid game himself, shutting down many of Mo Salah’s runs down the right side. As for Arsenal’s other two defenders, questions remain as to whether they can hold their own going forward. David Luiz has had many problems since the restart, conceding many goals and getting burned by pacey forwards. Rob Holding found himself starting over the usually favored Mustafi, and ran into many problems on the left side with Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson coming at him repeatedly. Arsenal have a lot of attacking talent, however, if they want to contend for the title next season they need to sure up their back line.

      <h10><b>4. Lewandowski And Muller Aging Like Fine Wine</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In similar fashion to Messi and Ronaldo continuing their excellence as they get older, Bayern’s Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski seem to be only getting better with age. Muller set a new Bundesliga record this season with 21 assists and Lewandowski won another domestic golden boot with 34 goals in 31 games. He is also the top scorer in all European competitions this season with 55 goals and would have been a strong candidate for the Ballon D’or had it not been cancelled this year. These breakout seasons from Bayern’s veterans could be the thing that they were missing in past seasons where they failed to win in Europe. With additional young talent in the likes of Serge Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich, and Alphonso Davies, Bayern seems to have found the perfect mix of veteran experience and wonderkids to find success in all their competitions.

      <h10><b>5. Vidal Eats His Words</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Sometimes it is better to keep your thoughts to yourself, a lesson that Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal had to learn the hard way during today’s game. In a news conference on Thursday, Vidal chose to share his thoughts on Bayern following one of the reporters claiming that they would need to make many mistakes in order for Barcelona to beat them. Vidal responded to these claims by saying, “I know Bayern's players and what's said has come from outside and is not what [the players] think. They have a lot of confidence but they're not playing against a Bundesliga team on Friday, they're up against Barcelona, the best team in the world.” Vidal had little to no influence on the game as his team was torn apart by Bayerns relentless attack. Maybe next time he’ll think a bit longer before he makes such bold statements.
