      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 6 - 2 Leeds United</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Roses Derby returned to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years and it made for a tantalising encounter. Leeds United have enjoyed a very positive start to the season and, with their brand of football, have shown that they can go toe-to-toe with the very best. Man United are the most in-form team in the country and came into this game knowing a win would take them into the Top 4. It was a monumental occasion, especially for young fans like myself who have never witnessed the rivalry. A story going back to the days of Cole and Yorke and Hasselbaink and Viduka, the betrayals of Cantona and Smith and, of course, who can forget, the legendary duels of Keane and Haaland. But that is now in the past. It was time for new memories to be made and new stories to be written.

      <h10><b>1. Not A Day For The Superstars</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        All those who missed the game and read a 6-2 scoreline can be forgiven for thinking that the likes of Martial and Rashford had had a field day in front of the goal. Much to the dismay of fantasy players around the globe, however, that was far from the truth. Both players had fantastic games (more on that later), but the spotlight last night fell on those who aren’t always used to it. Scott Mctominay became the only player to ever score two goals within the first three minutes of a game in the Premier League and put in a typically rugged and confident display from start to finish. His simplicity, use of physicality and calmness under pressure and traits tailor-made for this United midfield and his performance earned praise from Roy Keane himself. The fourth goal then came from Victor Lindelof who, despite a up and down start to the season, has put together a great run of form and was awarded with a beautiful first post flick on from Anthony Martial. The Swede may not be the most glamorous player on the pitch, but he is building in confidence and took his goal very well. The one that must have pleased United fans and the most would have been the performance on Daniel James. A surprise pick for the first eleven, the Welshman took the first steps towards answering his critics with an energetic performance, capped by an extremely well placed shot through the feet of a helpless Meslier. Dan James’ tough start to life in the Premier League has been well documented, but having the trust of the manager to start in a game of this magnitude and performing well against Leeds of all opponents will do his confidence a world of good.

      <h10><b>2. Too Naive And Too Overwhelming</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Fortunately for Marcelo Bielsa and Leeds, being humbled by the Red Devils has not brought upon a whole lot of criticism for the Peacocks. While the football industry is often labelled as reactionary, it is laughable that any team and any manager, especially a team and manager of the stature of Leeds and Bielsa, should walk away for a 6-2 defeat unscathed. Mainstream media might be okay with that, but I am not. So let’s change that. Marcelo Bielsa was brave in setting his side up the way he has all season and he paid the price. United started the game on the front foot and were too hot to handle for Leeds. The large space they leave between their midfield and defense is usually patrolled by Kalvin Phillips, but he was invisible in the first 45 and his return from injury was marked by the most uncharacteristic of performances causing him to be taken off at half-time. With the back four stretched and stranded, Rashford, Martial and Bruno Fernandes exposed them throughout the game and had they been more clinical, the game might just have ended with a cricket score.

      <h10><b>3. Viva La Oleball</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Moving on to the manager in the home dugout, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrated two years in charge of United with a game that reflects just how much his side have improved in his time. United, for all of last season and this season as well, for one, not scoring enough goals and two, scoring a lot of penalties. Last night, United scored from a counter attack, a corner, a shot from outside the box and a penalty. Ole might not be the most tactically astute manager out there, but he is trying to give his players the best platform possible to go out there and express themselves. ‘Oleball’ is a lot more than just how United play. With a global pandemic, a shorter season and the added fixture congestion that comes with European football, Ole has made full use of the squad given to him. Last week, against a pragmatic Sheffield side, he fielded Paul Pogba and Alex Telles - players who always have one eye on attack. This week, against an intense pressing unit, he picked Fred, Mctominay and Luke Shaw. The two number 6s were brilliant under pressure and Luke Shaw showed his defensive stability his Portugese counterpart would almost certainly have not provided. Other than a handful of players, Solskjaer has managed his squad really well and that has paid dividends, as United have not faced as many injuries as other top clubs and recorded a season-high distance covered and sprints made. He might not be perfect, but he is doing a great job and it is time mainstream media acknowledged that.

      <h10><b>4. Bruno Fernandes, Best In The Prem?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It has been almost eleven months since Bruno Fernandes moved to Manchester. In that time, he has played 42 times for the club and has 40 goal contributions. In the recent FIFA awards, he was voted by his colleagues across the world as the 4th best midfielder. The list of stats is endless and while his goal tally is inflated by the number of penalties he scores, his impact is undeniable. Last night’s game was a perfect representation of how the Portugese magnifico is so much more than the goals he scores and assists he provides. He is often central to everything good that the team does and his ability to perform every single game is priceless. There was a moment in the second half, right after a United corner, when Harry Magurie chose to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a striker and decided to not fall back for a good 45 seconds. For that period of time, the number 10 partnered Victor Lindelof and in defense prompting the commentator to mark, in bemusement might I add, “My god, he’s everywhere.” The christmas period is a crucial one for the Red Devils and if he is to maintain this form, we could be in for a top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool in January.

      <h10><b>5. Perch Secure?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        One of the most iconic quotes of the Premier League era is one we’ve all heard. Something about a perch and something about liverpool being knocked off it. United fans are as proud as they come and a big reason for that is their current 20-19 lead over Liverpool in terms of first division titles. Nevertheless, Liverpool look like the team to beat and even without their starting centre-backs, their road to a 20th league title and parity with their Manchester rivals may not be as difficult if the teams below them cannot find consistency. It is too soon for United to be labelled as title contenders in a large part due to their inability to win when it matters most and by the end of the Christmas period and the United Liverpool match in January, the Premier League table might be almost unrecognisable from what it is now. However, United may not want to depend on anybody else. If this team and this manager truly wants to become like the United of old, they are going to have to show a lot of heart and desire to keep their perch their own. Maybe they are the only ones who can do it or maybe they are far from being challengers. One thing is for sure, a Manchester United and Liverpool title race is the perfect thing to kick 2021 off.
