      <h12><b>Final Score: Ajax 0 - 1 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Missing three starters due to injury, a slightly crippled Liverpool team travelled to Amsterdam yesterday to face the Dutch side Ajax in each team’s first Champions League fixture. The two sides went back and forth, launching numerous counterattacks to no avail. A Tagliafico own goal in the 35th minute proved to be the only pivotal moment of the match, as both sides failed to convert any chances of their own. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Liverpool’s Patchwork Back Line Steps Up</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Following a potential season ending ACL injury to Virgil Van Dijk last weekend, Liverpool will now face the remainder of their matches without him at the heart of their defense. To make matters worse, fellow center back Joel Matip along with star goalkeeper Alisson both missed yesterday’s game due to injury, forcing coach Jurgen Klopp to improvise. Defensive midfielder Fabinho was called into action at center back for the fixture and proved to be a crucial figure in Liverpool’s defense. Numerous tackles in and around the box paired with a goal line clearance were vital to keeping a clean sheet and securing a win for his side. As Joel Matip recovers to full fitness, it will be interesting to see how Klopp forms his defensive line going forward, and whether or not we will see Fabinho continue in his role as center back.

      <h10><b>2. Klaassen and Blind Hold Down the Fort for Ajax</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Facing one of the most dangerous front threes in football, Ajax’s defense was handed the tall task of keeping them off the scoresheet. While their defensive brilliance was a team effort overall, defensive midfielders Daley Blind and Davy Klaassen proved vital to their side’s defensive success. Making key tackles in their defensive third and pushing attacks forward, the two Dutchmen were a problem for Liverpool all over the pitch. In fact, Klaassen nearly found himself scoring the equalizer, however, the shot ricocheted off the post away from the back of the net. Perhaps it was their history against the English side that motivated them, with Blind being formerly of Manchester United and Klaassen of Everton. While Ajax still suffered an unfortunate loss, manager Erik ten Hag will have many positives to reflect on as they prepare for their future matches.

      <h10><b>3. Klopp Makes the Most of the Five Substitution Rule</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Despite many domestic leagues, including the Premier League, returning to the standard three substitutions per match, this year’s Champions League will continue the five substitution limit instituted following the restart. This rule allows for two additional subs for each side, providing a break for some starters who rarely get time off. Following an exhausting and hard fought Merseyside Derby over the weekend, Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp decided to give his front three a rest, subbing an entire new attack in the 60th minute. While this move seemed very risky with so much time left to play, the substitution turned out to be a genius move as Liverpool was able to rest their star players while still picking up all three points from the match. As their rigorous schedule continues, it will be interesting to see how Klopp chooses his lineups in both Premier League and Champions League matches in order to avoid any more serious injuries to his squad.

      <h10><b>4. Ajax’s Attack Unable to Find a Rhythm</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Despite having a few clear cut chances to score, Ajax’s front three of Promes, Tadic, and Neres were unsuccessful in finding the back of the net, an uncharacteristic showing for the Dutch side. Averaging more than two goals a game in their domestic league, it seemed as though Ajax’s front three were unable to find their rhythm during the match. On numerous occasions, mistimed runs from Quincy Promes turned would-be goals into a free kick for their opponents. While there were some moments of brilliance forcing tough saves from Adrian, Ajax’s overall attack was lackluster and lacked the clinicality needed to win their game. Facing the high scoring attack of Atalanta next week, Ajax will need to convert more chances if they hope to gain any points from the match.

      <h10><b>5. Both Teams Need to Play Well to Make it Out of the Group</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      With three domestic league champions and a UCL quarterfinalist in Atalana, Group D is proving to be one of the most competitive groups this Champions League season. With only two teams advancing, it is poised to be a battle between Liverpool, Ajax, and Atalanta for the top spots in their group. Each of these teams have prolific attacks and have had much Champions League success in the last couple seasons, so it should result in a nailbiter finish for those top two spots. With Atalanta pulling out a 4-0 victory over Danish side Midtjylland yesterday, they sit atop the table with Liverpool right behind. A win over the Italian side next week would be enormous for Ajax as they look to make it past the group stage following their blunders last season.
