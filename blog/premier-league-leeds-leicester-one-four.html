      <h12><b>Final Score: Leeds United 1 - 4 Leicester City </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While the superpowers of the European game stutter and falter and scramble their way up the Premier League table, the last match of gameweek eight of the league served up a tantalising encounter. Leeds United and Leicester city have shown the rest of the league that the combination of a tactically astute manager, a workman-like team defined style of playing can do wonders for clubs that, compared to the traditional top 6, do not have the same financial resources. Last night, however, Leicester proved too strong for the men from Manchester as they ran our 4-1 victors on the night.

      <h10><b>1. Hats Off, Brendon</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As I said before, both coaches have been praised for the way they set up their teams in different games, but on the night, Brendan Rodgers’ plan was the superior one. Still missing key players in the form of Ricardo Perreira, Johnny Evans and Wilfred Ndidi, Rodgers set up with three centre backs, flanked by Luke Thomas and Marc Albrighton in the wing back roles providing a lot of defensive cover. Further up the pitch, Vardy, Barnes and Praet’s workrate ensured that Leeds found it difficult to play out the back. This pressure was sustained throughout the game and the Foxes rarely gave the Leeds men a moment’s peace at Elland Road. Two players that have allowed Rodgers to implement such a strategy are James Justin and a resurgent Nampalys Mendy. Justin’s versatility means that he took on the right centre back position with relative ease and put in the kind of performance we have come to expect from him. Mendy has stepped in the absence of Ndidi and shields that backline expertly as well as helps progress the ball up the field where the likes of Vardy, Barnes and Tielmans can create havoc. Rodgers had drilled his team beforehand and it showed as the Foxes were just too much for Bielsa’s men.

      <h10><b>2. A Tale Of Two Strikers</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It is often hard to give a short summary of a football game because of how fluid and for the lack of a better word, moody, it can be. Games can have completely different complexions before and after half time or a substitution and most competitive games don’t stay the same for the entire ninety minutes. However, Leeds seemed determined to stick to their philosophy throughout, which is credible, but it simply wasn’t working last night. The game was portrayed in a nutshell in the third minute. At one end, fresh off his hat-trick against Villa, Patrick Bamford fluffed the easiest of chances, heading straight into Kasper Schmeichel’s hands from less than six yards out. 30 seconds later, Harvey Barnes opened the scoring at the other end of the pitch after a defensive mix up from Leeds. They found it difficult to create much for their number nine, who in turn found it even harder to convert the few chances he got. Jamie Vardy, on the other hand, notoriously good at making the best out of a small portion of chances, also showed great intelligence and ability in the build up to both first half goals. The Peacocks barely got into the game, making uncharacteristic mistakes all night and as I see it, there was only one reason why.

      <h10><b>3. Kalvin Phillips Key</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Leicester United play a 4-1-4-1, a formation not seen very often at the highest level of the English game. For Bielsa and Leeds, however, the system has worked wonders and they owe a lot of that to Kalvin Phillips. The Englishman isn’t your typical hardman at the centre of midfield. While he does do the dirty work, breaking up play constantly, his passing is one of his best qualities. He is able to find the wingers in space every now and then while also being able to hold the ball in midfield without any panic. Without Phillips at the centre of the park, Barnes and later Maddison and Under found a lot of space between the defensive line and the midfield, giving them the time on the ball to create something. In the build up to Jamie Vardy’s goal, Maddison found himself in acres of space and had an abnormal amount of time to look and thread the ball through the Under before the Turkish international beautifully set up Vardy for the second week running. Yes, Maddison’s touch was great and took his opponent out of the game, but Leeds’ soft center was apparent throughout the game and they will be hoping to have their starting CDM back as soon as possible.

      <h10><b>4. He’s Having A Party</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The United Kingdom might be going into another lockdown, but there’s nothing they can do to stop the Jamie Vardy Party which does not seem to have any intention of slowing down. He followed up a wonderful hat trick against the Cityzens with a diving header at the Emirates and now put in a commendable performance at the home of the Division 2 champions. His movement off the ball is unrivalled. His striker’s instinct is making him part of an increasingly rare breed and it is a shame that the modern game does not seem to value his ability to sniff danger and goals as much as it seems to value strikers who bring others into play rather than scoring themselves. While both kinds of strikers fit into different systems, there isn’t a manager in the league right now who wouldn’t want Jamie Vardy. Alas, Leicester have held onto him and it is paying dividends. Leicester’s Fantastic Mr. Fox is now just one goal behind Dominic Clavert-Lewin in the race for the golden boot, and although it is early days, I wouldn’t put it past him to make it two in a row, especially with the likes of Barnes, Under, Maddison and Praet playing around him.

      <h10><b>5. European Super League, Blessing In Disguise?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Here me out. The idea is clearly fueled by money. The biggest clubs have only been getting bigger and bigger and this league would be the icing on the cake. Would the Super League dissolve the value of rivalries? Theoretically, yes it should. If Real Madrid are playing Barcelona multiple times a year as opposed to only twice, its value will diminish in the long run. However, how would the Premier League be affected by the loss of at least five of its top six. It might sound crazy, but it could be just what the league needs to become more about football and less about money. The likes of Bielsa and Rodgers are showing that the English game does not entirely depend on their top teams for entertainment. It is a pipe dream of course. The minute a European Super League begins, the amount of money being pumped into  the competition will attract all the best players as well as managers like Bielsa and Rodgers, but we can only hope. Hope that the purists, the likes of Bielsa will stick around, and prevent the greed for money from devouring the sport we all love.
