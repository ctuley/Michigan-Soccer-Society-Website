      <h12><b>Final Score: PSG 3-0 RB Leipzig</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While some - including me - may have expected more of a competitive match, the talent gap between PSG and Leipzig was too much for the German club to overcome. Individual errors at the back ruined the game plan Nagelsmann concocted to shut PSG down, but they would have struggled to create chances regardless. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. PSG Starting To Fire On All Cylinders</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It took a long time and the introduction of Kylian Mbappe for PSG to get up to speed against Atalanta in the quarterfinal, but with their normal front three on the field from the start against Leipzig, PSG felt like a much more powerful force for the entire 90 minutes. It’s not easy to beat Leipzig - they’ve only lost four games this season and drawn twice against fellow semifinalists Bayern Munich - but PSG thoroughly dominated the game. It was a complete performance for the French champions, who created tons of chances and kept Leipzig at bay for the most part. PSG won the xG battle 3.21-1.23, but Leipzig didn’t even get their best chance until the game was long over in the 82nd minute - a shot from Patrick Schick with an xG of 0.43. PSG will also be pleased with the return of Marco Veratti, who if fit for the final would be an extremely valuable asset in breaking Bayern Munich’s press. PSG could be peaking at just the right time, and they are as close as they are ever going to get to their first Champions League trophy.

      <h10><b>2. Leipzig’s Game Plan Foiled By Sloppy Errors</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        We’ll never know if Julian Nagelsmann’s tactics were good enough to beat fellow German Thomas Tuchel. Although PSG were giving Leipzig trouble early, the 4-1-4-1 seemed like it was going to be able to keep the game tight. PSG even blew a great early chance when Neymar hit the post after a one-on-one with Gulacsi. Unfortunately, Angel Di Maria’s early free-kick found a wide-open Marquinhos and it all seemed to unravel for the German side from there. PSG’s front three looked like it completely overwhelmed Leipzig’s backline and goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi made a critical error when his poor pass fell to PSG high up the field and led to Di Maria scoring the second goal. The third goal came from another individual error as Nordi Mukiele tried to sell an obvious non-foul by lying on the ground. This played Juan Bernat onside and he had another wide-open header from close range to make it 3-0. Leipzig just didn’t execute tonight, and when the talent gap is as wide as it was, it’s crucial to not make silly mistakes like the ones they did.

      <h10><b>3. Angel Di Maria Shows He’s Not Just The Third Wheel</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Much of the focus on PSG’s front line will surround Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. There's a good reason for this, as those two players are two of the best in the world, but Angel Di Maria seems to be a bit underrated in the wider soccer discourse because he’s seen as a weak link. Against Leipzig, Di Maria showed he’s not a weak link, and that he might actually be just as important as the other two. Di Maria has PSG’s top creative threat this season, especially in the absence of Neymar. He ranks 1st in expected assists per 90 with 0.62, he ranks second in shot-creating actions and passes into the penalty area per 90 with 6.12 and 4.10 respectively. This threat showed up tonight as he picked up assists for the first and third goals - and got on the scoresheet himself. In American sports, we talk a lot about “glue guys” - players that typically aren’t in the spotlight but are vital to their team’s success. Di Maria is PSG’s glue guy, and they’ll need him to perform well if they want a chance to beat (what will likely be) Bayern Munich.

      <h10><b>4. The Talent Gap Is Only Getting Larger</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        We may have been spoiled by last year’s Ajax squad or Lyon’s victories over superclubs Juventus and Manchester City, but the sad fact is that we shouldn’t expect many results like that in the near future. As fun as Leipzig are, and as great a manager as they have, they lost this game for one reason and one reason only: They do not have the talent to compete with clubs like PSG. Perhaps Timo Werner could have helped the German club give PSG more of a game, but he’s been plucked away by another superclub, and he’s not the only one. Teams like Leipzig actually could compete if their squads weren’t able to be picked apart before they reach their potential. Not that I’m arguing for an NFL style “play until the end of your contract”, it’s part of the game and clubs that know they are selling clubs are usually ready to reload when they need to anyway. It’s just a little frustrating to see high potential teams unable to close the talent gap because they lose their players before they reach the top of their game.

      <h10><b>5. If PSG Can Finish This Off, What Comes Next?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Here they are. PSG are on the edge of glory. They are one game away from achieving the one goal this ownership team has wanted since they bought the club in 2012. The Champions League is theirs for the taking, and they’ve got a great shot at finally bringing home Europe’s biggest title. But what comes next? Where does PSG go from here if they can actually win the Champions League? There is literally nowhere else to go, nothing else to win. Do they break up the team and try a hard reset? There are plenty of aging pieces of the core that will need to be replaced soon, maybe they just keep throwing money at the wall and see what happens. What about some of the stars? If Neymar and Mbappe have finally won the Champions League in Paris, will they feel the urge to stay if other teams can offer competitive wages? Will Tuchel stick around or will he want a new challenge? Who will PSG get to replace him if he leaves? There are plenty of intriguing questions that will surround the club if they can finish the job on Sunday. It should be exciting to see what happens.
