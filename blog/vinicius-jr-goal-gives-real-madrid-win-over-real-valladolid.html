      <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 1-0 Real Valladolid</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It was a game that Real Madrid could have put 3 or 4 more goals in, but all it took was one to beat a strong Real Valladolid side. Here are my five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Is The Jovic Experiment Over?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        For the second match in a row, Zidane has started Luka Jovic up to with Karim Benzema. While Jovic played better against Valladolid than he did against Betis, he still couldn’t replicate his lethal form from his Eintracht Frankfurt days. He did have good interplay with his teammates, but his finishing was poor. He had 3 big chances: the first came in the 17th minute, when he received a cross near the penalty spot, and put it just over the net with his first touch. It was a chance that a player of his caliber should finish, and Zidane was visibly frustrated on the touchline. The second chance came in the 35th minute, where Jovic had a chance on the volley from the left side of the area. He put it into the side of the net, and while I didn’t expect him to score, I did expect him to at least put it on target. His final chance came early in the second half, a header from a corner that he did well to put on target, but it was saved by Roberto. Overall, it was a poor night from Jovic, and I don’t believe that Jovic will start against Levante this weekend (though I would like to see Zidane try playing Jovic alone up top, as opposed to partnering Benzema).

      <h10><b>2. Benzema Continues A Poor Run Of Form</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        We’re three matches into the season, and Karim Benzema hasn’t scored yet. He has bagged one assist (against Real Betis), and forced an own goal against the team from Seville. On Wednesday night, he was his usual brilliant self on the ball, taking on defenders and setting up his teammates, but his finishing touch just wasn’t there. He also blew a major chance late in the second half when he misplaced a 2-yard pass to Vinicius Jr. that would have set him up with an easy tap-in goal. Zidane loves Benzema, and it’s hard to see him ever benching the Frenchman, so we’ll have to wait for Benzema to find his confidence again. Maybe Ramos will let him take a couple of penalties, as he’s done in the past.

      <h10><b>3. With Eden Hazard Out, Vinicius And Asensio Need To Be The Starting Wingers</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Eden Hazard is hurt again. It’s starting to feel dangerously close to what happened with Gareth Bale when he joined Real Madrid from the prem: muscle injury after muscle injury. With the Belgian set to miss the next 3-4 weeks, it’s safe to say that Vinicius should take his place on the left wing. He was great coming off the bench against Real Valladolid, and it only took him 7 minutes to find the back of the net from a Valladolid mistake. He looked fantastic for the rest of the match, until the very last play, where he caught Valladolid’s defense on a breakaway and was through on goal when he lightly chipped the ball into Roberto’s hands. It was yet another display of poor finishing from the young Brazilian, something Madrid fans have become accustomed to.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        On the other hand, Marco Asensio made his first appearance of the season against Valladolid, wearing his new number 11 shirt. He looked lively, although a bit timid at first, which is normal for a player coming back from an injury. His return is a welcome one, as Los Blancos have been in need of a quality right-winger since the season began, as Rodrygo is still quite raw and needs some competition.
      </h13>

      <h10><b>4. Real Valladolid Strong, But Not Strong Enough</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There was nothing wrong with Valladolid’s performance against Real Madrid, they were solid throughout. They just happened to get unlucky on the goal, as the ball bounced around the box and happened to land at Vinicius’ feet. Their defense, led by new signing Javi Sanchez, was solid, and they locked down both Benzema and Jovic well. It was once Madrid switched their formation from a front 2 to a front 3 that Valladolid began to have issues. The only real mistake that their defense made came from backup goalkeeper Roberto when he rolled the ball out to start a counter-attack in the 82nd minute, and it was intercepted by Luka Modric who then hit the post with his shot. Even though Valladolid hasn’t won a match yet this season (they are 0-2-2), they look to have a good team, and I am sure that they will find their form and escape the relegation zone where they currently sit (18th).

      <h10><b>5. Fabian Orellana Was A Good Acquisition</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I had no idea what to make of the 34-year-old Fabian Orellana’s free transfer from Eibar to Valladolid this summer. I had expected him to move back to Valencia (where he transferred to Eibar from) as they needed attackers. I was surprised that he chose Valladolid, as it wasn’t much of an upgrade from last season (Valladolid finished 13th, Eibar 14th). Needless to say, it was a good signing from Sergio Soriano, as Orellana has added a new dynamic to their attack. He is excellent technically, and his close-quarters dribbling is incredible. He had a mixed game against Real Madrid, as he caused their defense and midfield quite a few problems, but he never troubled Thibaut Courtois. Once this team begins to click, I expect Orellana to be at the center of it, and I look forward to seeing how he combines with forwards Sergi Guardiola and Oscar Plano.
