      <h13>
        Goals from Ferland Mendy and Karim Benzema were both needed as Real Madrid beat Granada to take their winning streak to nine.

              Real Madrid’s first half was fantastic, and it was capped off by two beautiful goals. Los Blancos had 72% possession, and it looked like the game was done and dusted after the first half. This was not the case, however. Granada came out flying after half-time, and it only took Darwin Machis 5 minutes to get the hosts a goal, as Casemiro had a terrible giveaway in midfield that caught Real Madrid’s defense out. After this moment, Granada controlled possession, and were very threatening. They had 13 attempts on goal in the second half, 4 of which were on target. Thibaut Courtois was forced to make 2 saves, and Sergio Ramos had to make a brilliant goal-line clearance.

      <h10><b>2. A Completely Different Squad From Granada</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Granada manager Diego Martinez made 5 changes from his side’s win against Real Sociedad on Friday. The most surprising of these changes were removing striker Roberto Soldado and star winger Antonio Puertas for Fede Vico and Darwin Machis (which paid off as Machis scored). These changes could be the reason for Granada’s excellent second half performance, as half of their outfield players had been rested in their last match.

      <h10><b>3. Will We See Gareth Bale Play For Real Madrid Again?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Gareth Bale has not appeared for Zidane’s side since his start against Mallorca on June 24th. Since then, he has been on the bench each match, but has remained an unused substitute. Zidane seems to be more concerned with winning games than pleasing his players (as he should), but it is hard not to feel bad for Bale. As Thursday’s match against Villareal could be the title decider, it is unlikely that we will see Bale play unless Real Madrid have a multiple goal lead in the second half. Maybe he will appear against Leganes on Sunday, if Madrid do happen to win the title on Thursday. It would be unfair to Gareth not to have a proper sending-off from Real Madrid, as he probably will leave in the summer.

      <h10><b>4. It Looks Like Granada Will Miss Out On European Football</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With two matches left to play, Granada now sit in 10th place in La Liga, 4 points off of 7th placed Real Sociedad. They still have matches against relegation-battling Mallorca, and 8th placed Athletic Club, and if they win both it is still possible that they could play in Europa League next season. No matter what happens, the team will have to consider this season a success, as a mid-table finish for a team who were promoted from La Liga Smartbank last year is very respectable.

      <h10><b>5. One Win Away…</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Real Madrid are one win away from their 34th La Liga title. If they win on Thursday against Villareal, they will be crowned champions at the Alfredo Di Stefano. If Barcelona draws or loses against Osasuna on Thursday, Real Madrid will be champions regardless of their result against Villareal. While it is still possible for them to bottle the title, it would be very unlikely for them to lose both matches, as they have won all nine of their matches since the restart.
