      <h12><b>Final Score: Sevilla 2-1 Manchester United</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Substitute Luuk de Jong grabbed the winner to send a high-flying Sevilla to the Europa League finals. Manchester United, on the other hand, were sent packing and will look to regroup before the start of the next Premier League season. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Another Penalty For Manchester United</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester United’s penalty tally for the 2019/2020 season has reached a staggering 22, including 2 in their last two Europa League matches against Copenhagen and Sevilla. The Red Devils are obviously reliant on spot-kicks to win them matches, and it shows in their attitude. They go down easily in the box and try to draw contact as opposed to shooting. This was apparent in Monday night’s match against Sevilla, as they had 0 shots after Luuk de Jong scored the eventual match-winner, despite having the majority of possession. They did, however, have multiple instances in the box late in the game where players tried to draw contact in hopes of earning a penalty, instead of attempting to shoot. One could argue that Manchester United’s lack of finishing ability due to their reliance on penalties lost them this match.

      <h10><b>2. So... Many... Fouls...</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both teams looked like they had been hitting the gym lately in this match. The game ended with 30 fouls (13 by Sevilla and 17 for United). This hurt the flow of play massively and could be the reason that Sevilla looked off for the first 70 minutes of the match. They couldn’t play their typical, free-flowing style that would allow them to keep possession and break down Manchester United. Even though referee Felix Brych only handed out 5 yellow cards in the match (Sevilla 2, United 3), it didn’t feel like enough. The game got rough at times, and there were definitely more times when cards could have been handed out. This was evidenced by how tired both teams’ players looked at the end of the match; they had all been battered and beaten. This could have been avoided if Brych had issued a few more cautions earlier on in the match; he let it get way out of hand, and both teams were lucky there were no significant injuries in Monday’s match.

      <h10><b>3. Sevilla Start Slow But Come Into The Match</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The whole Sevilla team looked off early in the match, they gave up many easy chances to United in the first half. They were poor in possession, giving the ball away needlessly, and their defense was even worse, relying on backup goalkeeper Yassine Bounou (who had an amazing game) to bail them out. This was exemplified in the 8th minute, when a few defensive mishaps led to Marcus Rashford on goal, where he was taken out by a late Diego Carlos challenge, resulting in a Manchester United penalty.
      </h13>
      <h13>
        The 26th minute was the only instance in the first half where we got to see the real Sevilla. Lucas Ocampos broke away down the left wing and centered the ball to Sergio Reguilon (who Fred had left wide-open). Reguilon played the ball across the net to right-winger Suso, who had an easy finish due to poor marking from United’s Brandon Williams.
      </h13>
      <h13>
        Only after de Jong scored in the 78th minute, and Sevilla were winning, did they begin to play well again. They kept the ball from a tired United side, and thoroughly outclassed them by having their full-backs get wide and make overlapping runs. They even got a few more chances on goal, and de Jong blew an easy chance to make it 3-1 by misplaying a pass to Nemanja Gudelj. United couldn’t handle peak-Sevilla's play, and Los Rojiblancos saw the match out comfortably.

      <h10><b>4. Atrocious Finishing From United</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        46 shots. 21 on target. 0 goals from open play. Those are the stats from Manchester United’s last two Europa League ties against Copenhagen and Sevilla. Granted, both teams’ goalkeepers had incredible performances against United, but for a team boasting the forwards Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood, and Bruno Fernandes, that is unacceptable. They had 7 shots on target against Sevilla on Monday night, including multiple clear-cut chances for both Greenwood and Martial, and they scored none of them. If United want to stand any chance in the Champions League next season, they will have to either add a player to their squad who is a proven scorer in cup competitions, or they will need their current forwards to drastically improve their finishing abilities in high-intensity matches.

      <h10><b>5. Can Sevilla Win The Europa League Again?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Sevilla won their last Europa League trophy in 2016, their third in a row. They are the kings of the competition, boasting 5 Europa League titles, two more than any other team. On Friday, they will face either Inter Milan or Shakhtar Donetsk in a bid for their sixth championship. If they face Inter, they will most likely be the underdogs, but if they play Shakhtar, they will be heavy favorites. I believe that if Sevilla show up and play their best football, they will beat either team. The way that they moved the ball around United at the end of the semifinal match was magnificent, and if they can replicate that, they will lift their 6th Europa League trophy Friday night.
