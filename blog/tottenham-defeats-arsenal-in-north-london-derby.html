      <h12><b>Final Score: Tottenham 2 - 1 Arsenal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Tottenham used goals from Heung-min Son and Toby Alderweireld to take all three points from the Gunners on Sunday. The mid-table matchup was entertaining throughout as both teams looked very threatening and hungry for goals. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Open Play Leads to Entertaining Derby</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Both sides were looking for three points to keep up in the Europa League race which led to an exciting match that was full of quality chances. The first half was particularly lively with goals less than three minutes apart scored by Arsenal’s Alexandre Lacazette and Tottenham’s Heung-min Son. There was a bit more focus on possession early in the second half, but Tottenham grabbed a late goal that once again allowed for play to open up as Arsenal pushed for an equalizer. Despite both sides being stuck in the middle of the table during disappointing seasons, the North London derby once again proved to be one of the best matchups in English football. As long as bragging rights are on the line, the Gunners and Spurs come to play and entertain the fans along the way.

      <h10><b>2. Arsenal Center-Backs Make Dreadful Errors…</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Arsenal has many pieces to contend for trophies: elite striking talent, solid midfielders, and steady play from goalkeepers (more on that later). What is holding Mikel Arteta’s side back is terrible play from its center-backs. The Gunners went with a 3-4-3 to start on Sunday with Sead Kolašinac, David Luiz, and Shkodran Mustafi leading the backline. All three defenders made dreadful errors that cannot be made by defenders on a team that hopes to contend in the Premier League. Kolašinac’s misplayed pass to an off-balance David Luiz allowed Son a chance that was well taken for Tottenham’s first goal, and I believe Mustafi set a new record for falls in a match played under perfect weather conditions. Arsenal’s backline was, quite frankly, embarrassing on Sunday and Arteta needs to look to the transfer market for upgrades. The Gunners could have easily given up more goals, but one man was determined to not let that happen.

      <h10><b>3. ...But Emiliano Martinez Keeps His Side in the Match</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Had Arsenal found a way to win, Emiliano Martinez surely would have been named man of the match. The 27-year-old Argentine played a fantastic match from the start, and it is truly a shame that he was let down by his defenders. Martinez made a difficult save on a good chance for Harry Kane early in the first half and followed it up with a beautiful dive to keep out Ben Davies’s effort from distance. He made every save he should have and more, which is more than one can ask for from a backup keeper. Martinez has been with Arsenal since 2010 but made just his 12th Premier League appearance for the Gunners on Sunday. Having been loaned out on six separate occasions, it appears that Martinez has done enough to solidify himself as Bernd Leno’s backup moving forward, with three clean sheets in five league appearances and a heroic performance against Spurs.

      <h10><b>4. Mourinho Sticks to His Plan</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although some fans may complain that his style is too defensive, José Mourinho’s brilliance was on full display on Sunday. It took a world-class effort from Lacazette to beat the Tottenham defense, but other than that the Gunners struggled to break down Mourinho’s men. Tottenham sat back and allowed Arsenal to possess the ball but struck when the moment was right, leading to many counter-attacks that put the fragile Arsenal defense in difficult positions. Son pounced on an error early in the first half and Alderweireld buried a perfect header off of a corner, but it was Tottenham’s counter-attack that truly frustrated Arsenal. If Harry Kane and Lucas Moura had been more clinical, Spurs could have easily won by a much larger margin. Mourinho will continue to push his players to perfect his system and finish off their chances. If all goes as planned his side will push for trophies in the next few seasons, and “the special one” may reclaim his spot amongst the best managers in the world.

      <h10><b>5. Arsenal Youngsters Fail to Make an Impact</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
There has been a lot of talk around the talented youth found in Arsenal’s first team squad. While many of these players have shown moments of brilliance and even some level of consistency, the youngsters who featured on Sunday failed to deliver for Mikel Arteta. English standout Bukayo Sako had little to no impact in his roughly 20 minutes on the pitch, while Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson barely saw the ball during their cameos in the dying moments. The Premier League can be an intimidating atmosphere for youth players looking for playing time, but Arsenal’s young stars need to make the most of their opportunities to not only help the team succeed, but to also prove they belong on the team sheet. With only three Premier League matches left (two of which are against teams fighting to stay up), Arteta should look to find ways to give his young players chances to prove their worth. If they continue to fall short of their expectations, look for Arsenal to be more active in the summer window than previously expected.
