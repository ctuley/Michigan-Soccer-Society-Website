      <h10>Chelsea Cruise to Victory Over Tottenham</h10>

      <h12><b>Final Score: Chelsea 2 - 0 Tottenham</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Aside from a few counter attacks and a disallowed goal from the away side, Chelsea completed a comfortable 2 - 0 win over their London adversaries thanks to a beautiful curling strike from Hakim Ziyech in the 47th minute and an accurate header from Thiago Silva just 8 minutes later. This result also continued the streak of no former Chelsea managers winning on their return to Stamford Bridge.

      <h10><b>1. The Blues are back on track</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With nearly twice the possession, shots, and shots on target than Tottenham, Chelsea had no trouble dispatching the Lilywhites. They held the ball for long stretches of time and patiently prodded their opponent’s defence, often resulting in incisive runs and crosses from the fullbacks. This match should give a huge boost to the side who calls Stamford bridge home, and with their next two matches being against easier opposition (English third tier side Plymouth Argyle and a to be determined opponent in the Club World Cup), they should be able to continue this good form and be prepared for the more difficult matches to come.

      <h10><b>2. Not all was bad from Tottenham</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Yes they were largely controlled by Chelsea, but there are still positives to take away for Antonio Conte’s side.
Primarily, Tottenham was disciplined as a defensive unit. There were some individual problems, namedly Japhet Tanganga’s temper, but as a whole the Spurs defence did a good job holding back the Chelsea attack for most of the match. A scuffed chance by Lukaku and Thiago Silva’s goal were the only notable transgressions. And for Ziyech’s goal: no one is stopping that.
Additionally, Spurs looked like they could have done damage on the counter attack if they had regulars like Lucas Moura and Son Heung-Min fully fit. Kudos to Steven Bergwijn as well for being the Lilywhites’ best attacker on the day.

      <h10><b>3. Applauds to the wingers in blue</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech looked unfocused and out of ideas in his side’s defeat to Manchester City last week, but today you could tell that he ate his Weetabix for breakfast. He moved well on the ball, distributed it effectively, and no goalkeeper on the planet could stop his postage-stamp, match-winning goal.
	Ziyech’s fellow winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi, also had one of his better matches in a Chelsea shirt this season. He looked confident with the ball at his feet and Japhet Tanganga was helpless every time he found himself in a one-on-one situation with his fellow young Englishman.

      <h10><b>4. Lukaku isn’t cutting it</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Blues’ marquee summer signing is clearly still recovering from the aftermath of his controversial Sky Italia interview as he was useless up front. It seems like Chelsea’s system just doesn’t fit his play style at the moment. The hulky Belgian thrived with his back to goal in Inter Milan’s counter attacking system, but that’s not how his current side plays. He now looks lost at sea when using possession-based tactics. Lukaku did play a bit better in the final thirty minutes of the match, but by this point his team was giving Tottenham the ball, and thus employing counter attacks, because they already had their decisive 2 goal lead. Maybe it’s time to give Werner and Havertz a few more starts again.

      <h10><b>5. Traoré will be a great help for Tottenham</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Tottenham fans should be drooling at the fact that Adam Traoré’s transfer from Wolves appears to be as good as done. As previously mentioned, Spurs looked like they could be dangerous on the counter attack given the proper personnel, and the pacey Spaniard has shown time and time again that he’s just the man for the job. Additionally, his ability to play wingback will allow Conte to fit most of Spurs’ stars into the same starting 11, all while putting the temperamental Japhet Tanganga on the bench as well. Adama Traoré won’t fix all of Tottenham’s issues, but he’s undoubtedly a step in the right direction for the side desperate to win a trophy.
