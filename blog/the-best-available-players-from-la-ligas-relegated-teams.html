    <h13>
      Espanyol, Leganes, and Mallorca were the three teams relegated from La Liga in the 2019/20 season, meaning that they will play their next campaign in La Liga Smartbank, the spanish second division. Being relegated to La Liga Smartbank presents a side with numerous challenges, one of which is the inevitable occurrence of bigger clubs buying the most talented players from the relegated sides. In this article I picked a few of those players to showcase that I believe should be picked up by larger sides.

    <h10><b>Mallorca:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Ante Budimir (Position: FWR, Age: 29, Market Value: €14 million)</b><h12>
    <img src="../blog-img/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Budimir checks all of the boxes that a top tier team would want in a striker: he has La Liga and Serie A experience, scored 10+ goals in his most recent season, and is in the prime of his career at 29 years old. While not contributing much for his team creatively (ranking in the 26th percentile for expected assists and the 24th for passes into the penalty area), he is a fantastic finisher. He finished the 2019/20 season with 13 goals in 35 league appearances, an excellent tally for a player playing his first season in La Liga.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Craotian is an expert at finding space in the box to shoot, which is reflected by his ranking in the 80th percentile for shots taken per 90. Once he takes his shot, he usually finds the back of the net, which is proven by his position above the 90th percentile in expected non-penalty goals per 90 minutes played, and expected non-penalty goals per shot taken.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Budimir would be a great fit for any team that needs a no-nonsense striker who consistently hits the back of the net. I think that he would be a great fit at Eibar, who need to improve their squad with a quality striker. They scored the least amount of goals last season in La Liga, and I think Budimir would complement their squad nicely, as he has proven that he can score many goals in a team with little offensive output.

    <br></br>


    <h12><b>Unai Bustinza (Position: CB, Age: 28, Market Value: €3 million)</b><h12>
      <img src="../blog-img/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: rtve.es</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The valuation of €3 million for Bustinza is just absurd. He has 9 years of La liga experience, and has performed at a top level with two different clubs (Athletic Club and Leganés). While he is not the best player when his team has possession (ranking in the 19th percentile for both passes completed and completed passes while under pressure), he is an astute defender. He ranks in the 96th percentile for (possession adjusted) interceptions per 90 minutes played, as well as the 90th percentile for ball recoveries per 90.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While he won’t fit any top teams due to his lack of skills in possession, I believe that any lower-level La Liga team would be lucky to have him. He would be a great fit for any one of the promoted teams joining La Liga for the 2020/21 season, and his leadership qualities can only benefit whichever team he joins.

    <br></br>


    <h12><b>Oscar Rodriguez (Position: MF, Age: 22, Market Value: €14 million)</b><h12>
      <img src="../blog-img/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams-6.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Oscar felt like a strange addition to this list because he doesn’t actually play for Leganes, he was on loan from Real Madrid. Nevertheless, Real Madrid are planning on selling him in this transfer window, so he felt like a worthy inclusion.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Oscar is an attacking powerhouse. He averaged 2.73 shots per 90 minutes (94th percentile) from an attacking midfield role, and scored 9 goals this season. His shooting skills are matched by his ability to create chances, as he ranks in the 91st percentile for shot-creating actions per 90, as well as the 82nd percentile for both key passes and expected assists per match. His dribbling skills are also quite good, as he completes 1.97 dribbles per match, ranking in the 89th percentile. He also is an excellent dead ball specialist, and is a serious threat from free kicks.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Until last week Oscar looked set to join Villarreal, but with the Yellow Submarine adding Takefusa Kubo as well as (probably) Dani Parejo and Francis Coquelin, we will have to wait and see if the deal goes through.

    <h10><b>Espanyol:</b></h10>
    <br></br>


    <h12><b>Raul de Tomas (Position: FWR, Age: 25, Market Value: €15 million)</b><h12>
      <img src="../blog-img/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams-8.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After a terrible half-season spell with Benfica (where he played 7 matches and scored 0 goals), de Tomas was picked up by Espanyol (for a club record 21 million euros) in the hopes that he would inject some goals into their squad and keep them from being relegated. Sadly, it was all for nothing, as de Tomas only scored 4 goals in 14 matches and Espanyol were relegated.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite the poor season, de Tomas still has the potential to develop into a quality player, if he is given a chance by the right team. This season, he ranked in the 94th percentile shots taken per match (2.76), and the 90th percentile for non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes played (0.28). These statistics just prove that if he could join a team that can give him consistent, quality service, he could become a player that regularly scores 20+ goals per season.

    <br></br>


    <h12><b>Marc Roca (Position: MF, Age:23, Market Value: €15 million)</b><h12>
      <img src="../blog-img/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams/the-best-available-players-from-la-ligas-relegated-teams-10.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:85%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Finally we arrive at the gem of this list, Marc Roca. For the past 4 seasons, Roca has been the heart of Espanyol’s midfield. He is excellent in possession, proven by his 80% pass completion rate, and he is great at moving the ball from defense to attack. He ranks in the 91st percentile for progressive passes per match, and in the 55th percentile for shot-creating actions per 90 minutes played, which is exceptional for a holding midfielder.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      His ability when his team is on the ball is miniscule compared to his defensive capabilities. Roca ranks above the 90th percentile in pressures per 90 minutes played, balls won from pressures, ball recoveries, and tackles won per match. He truly is a midfield powerhouse that any team would love to add to their squad.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Roca has a release clause of 40 million euros, which is quite high, especially in this climate. I don’t expect any clubs to pay that much for him, but I believe that an offer in the range of €20 million will be enough for Espanyol to let their golden boy go.
