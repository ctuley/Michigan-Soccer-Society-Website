      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 0 - 1 Arsenal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Once a great rivalry, there is no denying that Manchester United vs Arsenal is a fixture that has lost significance over the last decade and akin to both clubs, is one that depends on nostalgia and memories of the games gone by to remain relevant in any way, shape or form. With both clubs trying to find their feet and having had disappointing starts to the season, not much was expected from the game. Nevertheless, the two great clubs did not cease to surprise, as they delivered one of the most forgettable games of the season, serving a stark reminder to their fans that the glory days are truly a thing of the past.

      <h10><b>1. Back At It!</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Following their poor showing against Leicester last week, what Arsenal needed more than anything were the win and the three points. This season has really not kicked off for the Gunners, and their fans will be hoping that a victory at Old Trafford can kick start their season. Indeed there were positives all over the pitch for Mikel Arteta, starting from the front. Alexandre Lacazette may not be finding the goal consistently, but he is gaining in confidence, as will talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who would undoubtedly have been relieved to see himself on the scoresheet again after failing to find the net since the first game of the season against Fulham. What would have particularly pleased the Arsenal faithful were the performances of Mohamed Elneny and new boy Thomas Partey, who bossed the four man midfield of Manchester United. Clips of Elneny pressing the United backline on the 91st minute of a grueling, rainy night in Manchester went viral after the game and the Egyptian received deserved praise for his drive and determination. It was not a vintage performance, but there were glimpses of promise.

      <h10><b>2. Gabriel Is A Gunner</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Brazilian was one of Arsenal’s marquee signings of the summer as Arteta looked to bolster his defensive assets. The former Lille man put in a fantastic performance, keeping Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood quiet for the majority of the game. With a combined 10 tackles and interceptions, he executed Arteta’s gameplan to the T, as Arsenal seemed like they wanted to prevent Rashford, Greenwood and Fernandes any time on the ball. Along with Holding and Tierney, the center back was quick out of the blocks, did not allow the United men to turn and cause havoc and even brought down his opponent when needed. However, he wasn’t far from the controversy that surrounded his foul on Greenwood in the 73rd minute. Completely dumbfounded by the tricky youngster, Gabriel brought his man down whilst on a yellow card and can consider himself lucky that referee Mike Dean took a more lenient view. A sending off could have changed the course of the game and titled the match into United’s favour. Alas, it wasn’t meant to be for the Red Devils and Gabriel walked away with what many believe was a man of the match performance at the home of the enemy.

      <h10><b>3. Two Steps Forward, One Step Back</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Ahh Man United fans, they never learn. Granted, it's hard to not feel giddy when the darling of Manchester, and indeed the nation, has just come off his first professional hat trick and his team has recently defeated the finalists and semi-finalists of last season’s Champions League. It is, however, becoming a familiar story for Manchester United. A good run of results is often followed up by inexplicable performances and any bubble of optimism is popped by the pin of reality. Manchester United are yet to find a defined way of playing where players have defined roles. Granted it has never been the United way to have a rigid system, it is unlikely that the midfields of yesteryear would have been  so easy to play through. Bruno Fernandes was completely shut down which, unsurprisingly, coincided with Man United’s inability to carve out clear cut chances. There were several questionable decisions made by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer including the change in formation which moved Paul Pogba out to a left wing position that he clearly is not suited to play in as well as the use of his substitutes. There’s a long way to go for Manchester United and this game was an indication that the team needs time more than anything else. Oh and perhaps it needs to play its best CDM in the deepest lying midfield position when the aim is to control the game. Just a suggestion.

      <h10><b>4. Cup Competitions Or Bust?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With the way things are going, Jack Grealish is likely to find it easier to get himself into the England starting lineup than anyone who tries to predict the Premier League will. Albeit the last two gameweeks have offered results which suggest that the league has sobered up, predicting the Champions, Top 4 or even a game has proved a Herculean task (Except for relegation of course, Fulham are going down and there’s nothing you can say which will convince me to believe otherwise). However, I believe it is safe to assume that both, Arsenal and Manchester United, do not have the firepower, squad depth or consistency to challenge at the top of the Premier League. Both clubs, however, as they always are, will be hungry for trophies, United in particular, who are yet to register any silverware under Solskjaer. While they may not be able to keep up with others for an entire season, both teams are more than capable of being ruthless on their day. The goal for both teams this season should be to build upon the positives that exist in the current squad and hopefully nick a trophy in the form of the FA Cup or the coveted and elusive Papa John's Cup.

      <h10><b>5. Oh How The Mighty Have Fallen</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In the buildup to every Manchester United vs Arsenal game, the previews are filled with iconic battles of the years gone by. From Martin Keown throwing himself onto Ruud Van Nistelrooy to Sylvian Wiltord’s jump celebration at Old Trafford, from Cristiano Ronaldo’s showboating at the Stretford End to Roy Keane’s infamous brawl with Patrick Vieira. Maybe it’s just old men who can’t accept anything but what used to be, but it seems impossible that such moments can be created in the modern football environment. For all the ranting and raving that Roy Keane does, especially regarding the attitude of players in the tunnel, he does have a point. This season we have already seen the likes of Roy Hodgson, Jose Mourinho and Steve Bruce publicly say that they’re starting to fall out of love with the game that they have devoted their lives to. It's hard to say whether these proclamations are simply frustration after an unfortunate VAR decision or if they are sentiments that will persist. Regardless, it is sad to see that the Battle of Old Trafford and Pizzagate have been reduced to what can only be described as a glorified, poorly coordinated dance-off
