      <h12><b>Final Score: Leeds United 1 - 1 Manchester City </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Every year is an interesting year in Manchester. This year, however, looks like it is going to be a special year. The promotion of Leeds United, a potential last season of Pep Guardiola at the Etihad and the all conquering, undisputed champions of the world - Ole Gunnar Solskjær and the showtime reds. The arrival of Pep Guardiola, Antonio Conte and Jurgen Klopp over the last few years has dawned a new era for the English game. These tactical geniuses have brought a certain level of sophistication, class and quality to the game, which had been lacking in years prior. Last night was as much about the local derby as it was about two of the greatest minds in world football coming up against each other for the first time in years.

      <h10><b>1. Leeds Not This Season’s Norwich</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Leeds’ start to this season’s premier league is extremely similar to that of Norwich City last year. Both got promoted as winners of the Championship. Both played Liverpool away in their first game. Both lost that game. However, both teams showed incredible promise, and about 13 months ago, Lucien Favre promised the league that Norwich would not turn to a dogged, conservative style of play, as most promoted teams do. It is expected that Leeds have the same stance. Both teams then hosted Manchester City, early in the season. Norwich’s win was pretty much when their season peaked. A valiant effort, but Norwich’s play, which might have been easy on the eye, did not translate into results. Leeds, however, look like they have the quality, tactical nuance and the intensity to play their own football, and survive in the league. It’s still early days, but I can assure you, Patrick Bamford will not go down the Teemu Pukki road.

      <h10><b>2. City Defence Looking Much More Solid</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        By no means was it a vintage City defense, but it was much better than the one they put out against the Foxes. While Ruben Dias did make his debut and was solid, a bulk of the credit for this improved defensive performance has to be given to I’m Eric Laporte. Just like Van Dijk at Liverpool, Laporte has this calming effect on the city defense, giving the impression of ‘Everything is under control’. There were few panicky moments and Leeds would have been disappointed not to capitalize on a good stretch of attacks midway through the second half, but Ederson and his defense were able to ward off all the threats. Yes, this defense still needs some coaching and Benjamin Mendy could do with a pick-me-up, but on the whole, things aren’t as bad as they seemed last time out.

      <h10><b>3. Do City Need A Striker?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Man City have been blessed with two exceptional strikers in Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus. At the same time, both have been plagued by injuries. When fit, they are two of the best in the league, but every season, City fans have grown accustomed to seeing either Sterling or Mahrez play in that no. 9 role. This season, with both injured, Pep has attempted to promote Delap and Palmer from the youth team, but opted to go with Mahrez down the middle, and it was pretty ineffective. Torres and Sterling, who both had fantastic games, were getting into some great positions, but Mahrez is not the type of player who knows how to work the 18-yard box. Mahrez dropped deeper in the second half to get on the ball, leaving the penalty area practically empty, causing most of City’s chances to be from long range. At this point in time, there are a lot of questions and a few answers. Persevere with the young kids until Aguero and Jesus are back? Pep of course is the master of the false nine, but does this City team have the personnel, namely the wingers and false nine, to play that system?  Ahh, if only they had someone like Messi… what a ridiculous idea, right?

      <h10><b>4. Kalvin Phillips For England</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Most people would walk out of this game heaping praise on Raheem Sterling, who was brilliant, or Ederson, who practically kept City in the game. The stand out player for me, without a doubt, was Kalvin Phillips. Playing as a lone no. 6 in 4-1-4-1, he shielded the defense valiantly throughout the game, and as he himself admitted in his post match interview, most of Leeds’ play went through him. He’s calm and collected on the ball, looks like he has the footballing brain to play the position and he’s learning week in week out from one of the best. England have lacked a star deep lying for years now, and if Gareth Southgate is to stick to his current system, Kalvin Phillips is the answer, not Harry Winks. Yes, there is significant competition in the form of Declan Rice and maybe even Jordan Henderson, who Southgate will be eager to incorporate in the team, even if that means playing him at CDM. England must not ignore young Phillips the same way they did Carrick, and although Southgate has made some questionable choices, his decision to pick Phillips for a second time running can only mean good things.

      <h10><b>5. A Great Advert For The Premier League</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        This game promised goals. Two fantastic attacks, two relatively leaky defenses. It ended 1-1. It did not disappoint, by any stretch of the imagination. Peter Drury summed it up perfectly as Kyle Walker made perhaps his 100th sprint at the 70th minute mark, ‘This is an exhausting match to watch, what it must be like to play goodness know’. I couldn’t agree more. This game kept you at the edge of your seat throughout. The intensity, the press and the counter attacks. Both teams were relentless in their pursuit and were forcing mistakes from the other team. The rain and the angst of an animated Guardiola on the touchline, with Bielsa snapping at the referee every now and again, only added to the atmosphere. It wasn’t just running, for the sake of running. Every pass, every movement has purpose and thought behind it. It was the kind of game that could go on for 180 minutes and you wouldn’t be bored. There was a part of me that did not want any of the teams to win, for how cruel it would have been on the other. That part of me was quickly squashed by the Manchester United fan in me. Wishing Leeds and Man City well? Things must be truly bleak for United fans right now. But no, last night, for the first time in decades, was about Manchester, but it wasn’t about Manchester United.
