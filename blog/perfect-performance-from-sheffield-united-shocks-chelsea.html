      <h12><b>Final Score: Sheffield United 3 - 0 Chelsea</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Sheffield United played host to Chelsea on Saturday and turned in one of its best performances of the season. Chris Wilder’s side played to perfection and frustrated Frank Lampard and his players for the full 90 minutes. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Sheffield United Efficient in Attack</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Sheffield knew that utilizing a 3-5-2 against a top side would lead to limited amounts of possession and chances, but the Blades made the most of their opportunities. David McGoldrick jumped on a rebound after a good save from Kepa to score his first goal of the day, and Oli McBurnie took advantage of lazy defense to give Sheffield a two goal advantage before half time. McGoldrick added a second to his tally late in the second half to seal the three points for Sheffield. Despite only having 24% of possession and four shots on goal, Sheffield made it count when it mattered most and ensured four points between two matches against Chelsea this year.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>2. Chelsea Center-Backs Give Questionable Performances</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Another match, another set of questions for the Chelsea center-backs. Kurt Zouma went the full 90 while Andreas Christensen played the first half before making way for Antonio Rüdiger at half time. It was a day to forget for all three defenders, and Frank Lampard will have some tough decisions to make for the rest of the season and in the transfer window. Zouma and Christensen were caught ball watching on McGoldrick’s first goal, and both defenders allowed McBurnie to rise up unchallenged for a header leading to Sheffield’s second. A poor clearance from Rüdiger left McGoldrick with an easy finish to seal the three points. All three center-backs showed moments of brilliance on Saturday, but inexcusable mistakes led to easy goals, making their performances questionable at best.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>3. Lampard Runs Out of Ideas</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Chelsea started the match in a typical 4-3-3 with familiar faces in the lineup. Lampard switched to a 3-4-3 at half time to try to beat Chris Wilder at his own game, bringing on Rüdiger and the out of favor Marcos Alonso. Chelsea pressed up the field and created more chances early in the second half, but many of these chances came in the form of low quality crosses from the wing-backs and wingers. Lampard replaced Christian Pulisic with Olivier Giroud to create a 4-4-2, but it was too little too late for the Blues. Chelsea tried to break down Sheffield with a range of tactical strategies, but the Blades held strong and gave up very few quality chances. Dean Henderson made every save he needed to and was confident in the air, putting the icing on the cake on a brilliant day for Sheffield.

      <h10><b>4. Sheffield Worthy of European Football Next Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Saturday is further proof that Sheffield United is ready and worthy to play in a European competition next year. While the Blades have an outside chance of making the Champions League (especially if Manchester City’s ban is implemented), it is looking increasingly likely that they will participate in the Europa League next season. This would be an incredible achievement for Chris Wilder and his players, especially considering the fact that they were competing in the third tier of English football as recently as 2017. Sheffield has taken the Premier League by storm by perfecting and sticking to Wilder’s system, and the side will look to add talent in the summer transfer window to continue to compete at a high level. Although their side may struggle to balance the demands of both the Premier League and a European competition at the same time, it is surely a great time to be a Sheffield United fan.

      <h10><b>5. Reece James the Lone Bright Spot for Chelsea</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Reece James has been an important player for Chelsea this season, featuring in league and cup matches for much of the year. The 20-year-old right back impressed during the 75 minutes he featured on Saturday despite the fact that Chelsea allowed three goals. James pushed up the right side and offered many of Chelsea’s most threatening crosses while also keeping up with his defensive duties. He was let down by his center-backs and Kepa (who once again put together a very lackluster performance) which overshadowed his solid play. James’s rise to the Chelsea starting 11 has pushed Marcos Alonso to the side with César Azpilicueta taking over the left-back responsibilities, but the Chelsea captain sometimes struggles to play with his left foot. Frank Lampard should consider investing in a natural left-back this summer as he appears to have his right-back of the future.
