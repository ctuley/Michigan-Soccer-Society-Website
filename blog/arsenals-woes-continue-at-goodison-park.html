      <h12><b>Final Score: Everton 2-1 Arsenal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Arsenal fell to in-form Everton on a chilly Saturday night at Goodison Park. Rob Holding’s own goal and a thunderous header from Yerry Mina were enough to trounce the Gunners, whose tumultuous stretch continues. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is Here to Stay</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As the old saying goes, “form is temporary, class is permanent.” Dominic Calvert-Lewin started the Premier League season in terrific form with a winner against Tottenham and a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion and he has not looked back. Although he did not find the scoresheet, the England international forced Rob Holding into an own goal to break the early deadlock and was Everton’s most threatening attacker throughout the match, winning headers in the final third and just missing on a spectacular effort from distance. With his 11 league goals this season, Calvert-Lewin has officially arrived as Everton’s go-to option at the top and will certainly be in the race for the Golden Boot this season and many seasons to come. If he continues to play at a level anywhere near where he is playing right now, he will surely be in Gareth Southgate’s squad for next summer’s Euro’s, likely as the second-choice option at striker behind Harry Kane.

      <h10><b>2. Arsenal Attackers Fail to Show Up...Again</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Arsenal have had a lot of trouble scoring goals in recent weeks, and Saturday was another tough day at the office for the Gunners’ attackers. Nicolas Pépé converted a penalty after a foolish tackle made by Everton’s Tom Davies, but aside from that and a late charge in stoppage time, Arsenal’s attack was dreadful. Although much can be said about poor tactics (more on that later), the forwards and supporting midfielders looked lifeless for most of the 90 minutes. Willian barely touched the ball in the first half while Eddie Nketiah looked lost in the final third, at one point choosing to shoot from the edge of the box when he could have dribbled in for a much higher percentage look. Pépé will likely be saved from harsh criticism as he got back on the scoresheet, but Arsenal fans should not be pleased with their record signing’s overall effort as he had little impact in open play. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s absence was palpable and worrying as the Gunners appear to be incapable of attacking without their captain in the side.

      <h10><b>3. Everton Football Club: Top Four Contender</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        2020 continues to be a weird year for the world and soccer. Everton currently sit in second place in the Premier League after 14 matches with no signs of slowing down. Recent efforts have proven that Carlo Ancelotti is a tactical genius as his side continues to beat opponents despite the absence of some of its most important players. The Toffees were without James Rodríguez, Allan, and Lucas Digne on Saturday night but were able to dismantle Arsenal by sitting back defensively, playing long balls to Calvert-Lewin, and taking advantage of set-pieces. Although Everton probably cannot be considered title contenders given their lack of pedigree, it is fair to say that they will be in the push for a top-four finish as multiple members of the big six continue to struggle with consistency. Should Everton finish in the top four, they will return to the Champions League for the first time since 2005 and may allow Ancelotti to go on a spending spree next summer. Something tells me that there will be a lot of special nights at Goodison Park in the coming years.

      <h10><b>4. Arteta Out?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Following Saturday night’s match, it’s fair to say that one club is feeling great about its manager while the other wrestles with a tough decision in the coming months. Simply put, a club of Arsenal’s size and pedigree should not be four points from relegation at this point in the season. Mikel Arteta does not have a squad capable of winning the Premier League, but he has enough proven players and flashy young stars to finish in the top half with ease. Although his players performed poorly at Goodison Park, Arteta’s tactics were even more dreadful. Letting Everton dominate possession in the first 20 minutes when everyone knows they are incredibly strong while playing with a lead? Playing cautiously for most of the second half despite trailing at the break? The lack of tactical awareness, along with the clear lack of discipline amongst his players, should cost Arteta his job. Arsenal will likely give their manager a few more months to right the ship, but don’t be surprised if the Gunners are searching for a new coach before next season.

      <h10><b>5. The Busy Road Ahead</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It’s the most wonderful time of the year - the holiday period of the Premier League. With every team playing multiple league games in a short period of time in the coming weeks (not to mention some teams still participating in the Carabao Cup), this window will likely determine the fate of many teams in England’s top flight. Everton host Manchester United on Wednesday in the league cup quarter-finals, followed by a trip to Sheffield United on Saturday and a marquee matchup with Manchester City just two days later. Down in North London, Arsenal host Manchester City in the league cup quarter-finals on Tuesday, followed by a derby with Chelsea and a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion. By New Year’s Day, we should have a better picture of how the Premier League will shape up come May as the truly elite squads will be able to rotate and navigate their ways through this busy time. Everton will look to confirm their status as a top-four contender while Arsenal need to make up ground and try to salvage a seemingly lost season. Regardless of the outcomes, the next few weeks should be fun for soccer fans around the world as the wildest year in some time comes to an end.
