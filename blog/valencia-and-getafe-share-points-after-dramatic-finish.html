    <h12><b>Final Score: Valencia 2-2 Getafe</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I came into this match really underestimating the Getafe-Valencia rivalry (which is bound by no location or history), and 9 yellow cards, 2 red cards, 4 goals, a lot of controversy, and 1 dramatic finish later, I have a newfound respect for the illogical hatred these teams have for each other. Here are my five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. No Kondogbia Gives Carlos Soler A Role To Fill</b></h10>

          <h13>
            With Geoffrey Kondogbia set to leave Valencia for the much greener pasture of Atletico Madrid, Valencia are losing yet another central midfielder (after Dani Parejo and Francis Coquelin left for Villarreal). However, there may be a silver lining to the departure of the Central African Republic man; it will give Carlos Soler regular playing time in his preferred central midfield position. He started there today, partnering Daniel Wass, and played quite well. He isn’t the best defender, but his technical abilities are astute, and he will be a key player for Valencia until they can reinforce their midfield.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>2. Yunus Musah Is A Serious Prospect</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The 17-year-old had played a few matches for Valencia so far this season, but none as good as his match against Getafe. The ex-Arsenal academy player scored his first senior goal for Valencia against Getafe and became their youngest foreign scorer in history. He did off of a solo run in the 22nd minute, where he caught Getafe’s defense out after a counter-attack, carried the ball for 50 yards downfield, and slotted the ball past David Soria. His pace is blistering and his ball-carrying skills are improving, but his decision-making seems to be very good for a player of his age.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      *Interesting note: Musah was born in New York, and reports have come out stating that Gregg Berhalter has made contact with him about playing for the United States National Team. He hasn’t had a senior cap for England yet, so he still would be eligible to represent the USMNT.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>3. Thierry Correia’s Red Card Changed The Match (For The First Time)</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In the 48th minute, Thierry Correia received a yellow card for a poor challenge. 4 minutes later, he was sent off for a shirt tug on Marc Cucurella. This sent Valencia down to ten men, which is almost a death sentence when facing a high-pressure side like Getafe. This forced Valencia to pack numbers behind the ball to try and protect their 1-goal lead for the last 40 minutes of the match. Whenever Valencia would win the ball back, they would try and hit long balls into lone striker Maxi Gomez, who was so isolated up top that he failed to make anything happen. Because of this, Getafe held the ball comfortably for the majority of the second half and came quite close to scoring on many occasions.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Cucho Hernadez Drew Getafe Level Late-on</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It took until the 87th minute for Getafe to actually find the back of the net. Mauro Arambarri challenged Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech with a long shot, which the Spaniard could only parry straight into the path of Cucho Hernandez, who headed the ball towards the net. Gabriel Paulista got in the way of the ball but kicked it into his own leg and it bounced in (the goal was awarded to Hernandez, as it would have been a goal even if Paulista hadn’t touched it). At this point, Getafe were in the driver’s seat and brought the ball back to midfield quickly in search of a winner.

    <h10><b>5. And Angel Thought He’d Won It…</b></h10>

          In the 4th minute of extra time, Getafe debutant Abdoulay Diaby got the ball at the top of Valencia’s penalty box, where he had a clear view of the goal. He took the shot and it hit the post, falling right into the feet of Angel Rodriguez, who just had to touch it home. At this point, Valencia looked defeated, as they’d put so much effort into defending their lead, only to lose right at the very end. With two minutes left in extra time, Valencia went long straight from the kickoff, looking for all of their players in Getafe’s penalty area. In the thick of things, Dakonam Djene and Damian Suarez seemed to pull down Maxi Gomez, and a penalty was given. There were heated exchanges amongst the players, as everyone disagreed about the call. Suarez was shown a second yellow card for dissent against the referee (which seems to be a problem in the Getafe squad) and was sent off. It didn’t really matter though, as he’d already hit the 5 yellow card mark earlier this game (5 yellow cards in 7 games), so he would have been forced to miss their next match anyway. After 5 minutes of VAR looking at the play and the referee sorting out who to card for dissent and fighting, Carlos Soler stepped up to take the penalty. He sent Soria the wrong way and sealed a well-earned point for Valencia.
