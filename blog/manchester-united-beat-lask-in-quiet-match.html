      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 2-1 LASK (7-1 aggregate)</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Goals from Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial lifted Manchester United over LASK for the second time, in what was ultimately a very uneventful and lackluster match. Here are five key takeaways:

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>1. This Was Not The Lineup We Wanted From Ole</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When Manchester United released their lineup for last night’s match, I was disappointed. United were fielding their second team (their bench in most Premier League fixtures) when I believed they should have played their youth team. They already had a 5 goal lead from the first fixture, so there was no reason to play any first-team players for risk of them getting hurt (especially Harry Maguire). This match would have been a great experience for Manchester United’s youth players such as Ethan Laird, James Garner, Ethan Galbraith, and Dylan Levitt. None of them even made the squad for this match, as Ole decided to fill the bench with most of his starters. The only exceptions were Tahith Chong and Tedem Mengi, who both came on late in the match.

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>2. Neither Team Gave Too Much Effort</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both teams knew who would move on to the next round before the match even began. As there wasn’t much to play for, neither of the two teams put too much into the match. Both teams, especially United, squandered a few chances in the box, and the game could have easily had a couple more goals. There were no crunching tackles or hard fouls, as both sides wanted to prevent their players from getting injured. Another issue was how the teams moved the ball; there was no flow in this game whatsoever. Both teams had a pass accuracy that was below 80%, with LASK putting up an awful rating of 66% passes completed. As a result, this match had very little rhythm, and it was not an interesting watch.

  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>3. A Beauty From Wiesinger</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In the 54th minute, LASK broke the deadlock. After a corner kick was cleared by Timothy Fosu-Mensah, the ball fell to center back Philipp Wiesinger at the top of the box. He took the shot first-time and sent a rocket into the top right corner of the net. It was a sensational goal, but it would end up being a minor consolation for LASK, as they would have needed four more goals to overturn the deficit.
      </h13>

  <!-- 4th Row -------------------------------------------------->
  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. Jesse Lingard Makes It Two Goals In Two Matches</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Is prime Jesse Lingard back? The English youngster has two goals in his last two appearances, one of which was a wonder-strike against a quality Leicester side. His equalizer last night against LASK came off a breakaway, where he slotted the ball past the keeper like a prime (Brazilian) Ronaldo. In all seriousness, while I don’t expect Lingard to be a United player next season, it makes me happy to see him playing well and enjoying his football. Hopefully, he continues his fine run of form and he can be a threat off of the bench for the rest of this Europa League campaign.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>5. Now Onto Copenhagen</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After their win against LASK, Manchester United will now travel to Cologne, Germany to face FC Copenhagen on Monday. FC Copenhagen finished second in the Danish Superliga this season, and they beat Turkish side Basaksehir 3-0 last night. This is a match United should win, but anything can happen. They will need to be at their best against the Danish side, as all Europa League matches from now on are one-off, there is no second fixture. Expect to see more of United’s typical starters in this match, as Ole won’t want to take any risks.
