      <h12><b>Final Score: FC Barcelona 0-1 Getafe CF</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      In light of Real Madrid’s stunning loss to Cádiz earlier in the day, Barcelona looked to jump in the La Liga table on Saturday as they traveled to face a fearless Getafe side. Despite not losing to Getafe since 2011, Barcelona knew they were in for a battle. And that is exactly what they got. José Bordalás’s crew had a very aggressive start to the match, pressing high on the Barcelona defense and midfield and forcing several turnovers early on. Barcelona had no answer for the magical Marc Cucurella as he made plays all over the field, whether it was forcing turnovers or creating chances with nifty passes. After a rather uneventful 1st half that ended scoreless, Frenkie de Jong trips Dakonam Djené from behind in Barcelona’s box early in the 2nd half to concede a penalty. Jaime Mata blasts it from the spot past Neto to give Getafe the 1-0 lead, and the match would end 1-0 in favor of the home team as Barcelona did not play with much urgency on offense despite being down for much of the half.

      <h10><b>1. Getafe Was Aggressive on Both Sides</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Barcelona looked weak on both offense and defense, and much of that could be attributed to Getafe’s aggressive play style. They pressed Barcelona for the full 90 minutes, particularly through Cucurella and Cucho, and they had some good looking chances early in the match. This aggressive play was especially threatening in the early 2nd half, where Getafe earned themselves a penalty and used it to take the lead. Despite the return of Ousmane Dembélé, Getafe was able to make Barcelona’s attack look slow and lackadaisical thanks to a determined defense led by Djené. Simply put, Getafe looked like they had more energy than Barcelona for most of the match. Commentators Phil Schoen and Ray Hudson mentioned the International Break numerous times, perhaps suggesting that the Barcelona players looked exhausted from playing for their national teams. However, I give credit to José Bordalás for employing an aggressive approach. It could’ve very easily backfired, but Getafe stood strong and denied any chance for Barcelona to score.

      <h10><b>2. Koeman Puts Trust in Youth</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      While it is hard to find good things to say about Barcelona after that uninspiring performance, there is one thing that Barcelona fans should be extremely optimistic about: Ronald Koeman’s insistence on using youth players. He started Ousmane Dembélé, Sergiño Dest, Frenkie de Jong and Pedri; he also substituted Ansu Fati, Riqui Puig, and Trincão into the game. Koeman replaced Quique Sétien, the interim manager for Ernesto Valverde, and both of those managers were heavily scrutinized for relying on old veteran players. In a year where Barcelona appears to be facing years of rebuilding and failure (for their standards), it is a good sign that Koeman shows appreciation and trust for his youth players. It is important that he gives them adequate playing time as that will give them the necessary experience to succeed in the future. Messi will retire or leave the club soon, so Barcelona must ensure that they have enough experience to replace him.

      <h10><b>3. Cucurella Was All Over the Field</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Surprisingly, Lionel Messi was not the best player on the pitch today. It was Getafe’s Marc Cucurella, who did his best Messi impression all match long. Along with his deadly crosses and chance creating ability, he was a force on defense as well, giving Sergi Roberto a hard time out wide. His energy was unmatched and catalyzed the entire Getafe squad’s aggression, and he looked like he was playing with a massive chip on his shoulder. Had I not checked the lineups before the match to see that he was nominally a left-midfielder, I would not have been able to guess his position as he legitimately was all over the field. Cucurella will be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years, and he gave Barcelona a taste of their own medicine with his astonishing performance against them.

      <h10><b>4. Barcelona Attack Posed No Threat</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Whether it was due to international break or rustiness from Ousmane Dembélé who hadn’t played in nearly a year, the fact is that Barcelona’s attack was dreadful today. Yes, including Messi. Koeman employed his usual 4-2-3-1, but his go-to CAM Coutinho was on the bench to start the match. Instead, the front 4 consisted of Messi, Dembélé, Griezmann up top, and most surprisingly Pedri at the CAM spot instead. The young Pedri actually played very well against the intimidating Getafe defense, and he even set Griezmann up for an easy one-on-one finish that was unfortunately smashed above the crossbar. The rest of the attack looked lazy and uninspired to be quite honest, as the speedy Dembélé kept losing the ball and Griezmann couldn’t put his chances away.

      <h10><b>5. Pedri Steps Up to the Task</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      As mentioned earlier, Pedri was the lone star for the Barcelona attack. He connected his passes and created great chances that were unfortunately not put away by his teammates. Pedri was put in a difficult position at CAM, but he excelled through the pressure. I look forward to watching him play more this season, so I hope Koeman gives him more opportunities as a starter. Although he was subbed off for Coutinho in the 62nd minute, it was clear to everyone that he was special. For the first time in a while, Barcelona looks like they have a reliable slew of young players to count on, but the club must develop them sufficiently if they want to win trophies post-Messi.
