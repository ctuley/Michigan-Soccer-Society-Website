      <h12><b>Final Score: Chelsea 2 - 0 Wolverhampton Wanderers</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Chelsea clinched a spot in next year’s UEFA Champions League in convincing fashion with a win over Wolves on Championship Sunday. The Blues grabbed the last spot in the top four while Wolves finished the Premier League season in seventh place. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Mason Mount: Man of the Match</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Mason Mount has been the subject of scrutiny at different times this season. The Chelsea academy prospect got off to a hot start when the season began almost a year ago, but his inability to get directly involved on the scoresheet for the second half of the season left many Chelsea fans wondering if he deserved to be selected on a weekly basis. Frank Lampard kept Mount in his plans throughout the year due to his work-rate, and the 21-year-old finally rewarded his manager in the biggest match of the year. The midfielder opened the scoring with a clinical free-kick and grabbed an assist on Olivier Giroud’s goal just minutes later. He continued to make threatening runs and passes deep into the second half to keep the pressure on Wolverhampton’s backline. Mount will need to continue to play at a high level if he wants to keep his place in Frank Lampard’s 11 as the club has been linked to German youngster Kai Havertz for an expensive fee this summer.

      <h10><b>2. Wolves a Step Behind All Day</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Wolverhampton had a lot to play for on Sunday but failed to deliver an inspiring performance. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side could have clinched a spot in next year’s Europa League with a draw, however, his players looked lost for most of the day. Rúben Neves and Leander Dendoncker were outclassed in the midfield and Wolves’ forwards never put any real pressure on Willy Caballero in the Chelsea goal. Nuno replaced Pedro Neto with the always threatening Adama Traoré at halftime, but aside from a few displays of pace, the Spaniard had almost no impact on the match. Wolverhampton still has this year’s Europa League to see where it stands as a club, but Sunday’s match proved that there is still a sizable gap between Wolves and the truly elite sides in England.

      <h10><b>3. Chelsea Defenders Step Up When it Matters Most</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I, like many others, have been critical of Chelsea’s defense this season. Frank Lampard has had to constantly shuffle his center-backs and formations to try to cover up for his side’s defensive deficiencies, but his decision to play with five defenders against Wolves proved to be one of his best moves of the year. Antonio Rüdiger and Kurt Zouma looked strong in their typical center-back positions and the always reliable César Azpilicueta was just that as the third central defender. This steady and confident play allowed Reece James and Marcos Alonso to push up the flanks to join the attack, with the former offering up many of Chelsea’s best crosses throughout the match. Both wing-backs committed to their defensive duties as well to provide the finishing touches on a complete performance. Frank Lampard will likely look to buy one or two defenders before next season, but the defenders who featured today will surely be in his plans after such a massive performance in a crucial match.

      <h10><b>4. Wolves’ European Dreams in Jeopardy</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Wolverhampton has impressed this season, finishing seventh in the Premier League and currently competing in the last 16 of the Europa League. The squad is filled with talented and passionate players headlined by Raúl Jiménez, Rúben Neves, and Adama Traoré. In many previous years, a seventh-place finish in the Premier League was good enough for Europa League qualification, but this may not be the case this year. If Arsenal defeats Chelsea in the FA Cup Final on August 1, the Gunners will claim the last spot reserved for English teams in next year’s Europa League. As a result, Wolves’ only hope of playing in European competition next season would rely on their winning this year’s Europa League, but that appears to be a tall task with clubs like Manchester United and Inter Milan still in contention. Oddly enough, Wolverhampton’s fate appears to be in Chelsea’s hands as a victory for the Blues in the FA Cup Final would send Wolves to next year’s Europa League. Football fans around London will be intently watching Saturday’s final, but many fans in the West Midlands will be highly invested as well.

      <h10><b>5. Willy Caballero Provides a Steady Hand</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Frank Lampard dropped Kepa Arrizabalaga, the most expensive goalkeeper in the world, for his veteran backup Willy Caballero against Wolves. While some may criticize this decision, it was absolutely the right thing to do. Kepa has been out of form for much of the season, notably having the worst save percentage among qualified keepers in the Premier League and consistently struggling to be an effective distributor. Caballero had little to worry about on Sunday as his defenders made his job fairly easy, but he still had some key saves and interventions on crosses. Caballero, like many of his teammates today, stepped up and did what was required to get Chelsea into the top four. His selection and eventual solid play lead many to wonder - who will be Chelsea’s keeper of the future? Caballero is too old to be the consistent number one for an elite side, but Kepa’s dreadful play leaves Frank Lampard in a tough predicament. Will Chelsea spend more money to bring in André Onana or Jan Oblak? Will Kepa be given more time to develop and prove he is worth the price tag? Only time will tell, but expect Chelsea’s goalkeeping situation to be a hot topic in the summer transfer window.
