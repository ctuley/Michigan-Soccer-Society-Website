    <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool 4 - 3 Leeds</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The first game of Liverpool’s title defense took place at Anfield on Saturday where the reigning champs hosted Leeds, a side hungry for top-level football after being relegated 16 years ago. The scoring opened right away with a fourth-minute penalty by Mo Salah, which was matched by Leeds just eight minutes after. Sloppy defense by both sides opened up the game and an unfortunate penalty given away by Rodrigo allowed Liverpool to escape with a one-goal victory. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

            Following the restart of last season in June, Liverpool’s formidable back four have looked less and less daunting to play against. Against a strong Leeds attack, Liverpool’s defensive line was gaping with holes, frequently scrambling to win the ball back. Miscommunication and carelessness were evident throughout the game as Leeds’ unrelenting attack exposed the weaknesses in Jurgen Klopp’s defensive strategies. Gomez and Alexander-Arnold were frequently out of position and Van Dijk made a detrimental error that led directly to a goal, his second in four league matches. With a game against a terrifying Chelsea attack next weekend, Klopp needs to get his defense in shape if he hopes to earn another three points.

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It is not often that newly promoted teams pose a threat to the top clubs in England. However, Leeds might prove to be a difficult matchup for every team in the Premier League. With a sizzling attack and absolutely no quit in them, Leeds showed that they are here to contend. Despite missing their captain and best defender Liam Cooper, Leeds rallied after Liverpool’s opening goal, creating tantalizing counter-attacks and opening up Liverpool’s midfield and back four. Outside of the two unfortunate penalties given away, Marcelo Bielsa’s squad looked like a top club and one that will be able to score goals against nearly any defense. With 37 matches still to play, all eyes will be on Leeds to see if they can return to their former glory.

    <h10><b>3. Mo Salah Starts His Quest for Another Golden Boot</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Following back to back Premier League Golden Boot awards, Liverpool’s Egyptian king finished four goals behind Jamie Vardy in last year’s competition. In his first game of the season, Salah put on a show at Anfield, scoring three goals and leading Liverpool’s attack all game. His second goal, an absolute rocket into the top right corner, gave the Reds a 3-2 lead and his clutch penalty in the 88th minute gave the Champions all three points. Ever since his signing from Roma in 2017, Salah has been vital to Liverpool’s success, finishing the season as the club’s top scorer every year. Once called a one-season wonder by many critics, Salah continues to prove that he is a top player and a key to Liverpool’s world-class front three.

    <h10><b>4. Rodrigo’s Leeds Debut Leaves Much to be Desired</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After 62 minutes of play and down by one goal, Leed’s manager Marcelo Bielsa decided to go to his bench and bring on the newly signed Rodrigo Moreno. The 29-year-old Spanish international has made tons of noise at Valencia over the past four seasons. With 18 goal contributions in 34 games last year, Bielsa hoped to bring in a solid attacker who can open up the pitch and provide goals for the club. However, his Premier League debut did not go as well as many had hoped. After little to no involvement in the first 26 minutes he was on the pitch, Rodrigo was called for a clear and obvious foul in the box. His tripping of Fabinho gave Liverpool a late penalty which Salah stuck in the back of the net. While it was an unfortunate way to start the season, there is nowhere to go but up for Rodrigo as he gets accustomed to Bielsa’s system and the intensity of the Premier League.

    <h10><b>5. The League is Anyone’s to Win This Season</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With many top teams making big signings, the 2020/21 Premier League season is set to be one for the ages. Chelsea has had a record summer of signings, bringing in some top talent from other leagues to improve their attack and defense. Manchester United finished last season very strong, and the emergence of Mason Greenwood and Bruno Fernandes as top players in the league bodes well for their title hopes. Tottenham are finally at full strength and with Jose Mourinho at the helm, Spurs could be poised for a run at the title this season. Liverpool and Manchester City are the favorites to finish top two, however, this season will be no cakewalk. I expect one of the best title races in Premier League history this season and a top-four battle that will make every game a must-win.
