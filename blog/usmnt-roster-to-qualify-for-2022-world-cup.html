      Premier League, canceled. Olympics, canceled. COVID-19 has ended many athletes’ hopes of strapping on their laces one last time before summer. The logistics on how league trophies will be distributed and how relegation will work is still up in the air. However, one major event is still on track: World Cup 2022. The tournament will take place in Qatar from the end of November until right before the new year. The last World Cup failed to show the talents of Italy, Netherlands, and of course, the United States. This was the first World Cup the United States had missed since 1986.

            The past is the past. What happened on that night in Trinidad was a culmination of many factors seen in the months prior. It was the lack of organization by Jurgen Klinsmann, the lackluster performance against Guatemala—whom we had not lost to in 32 years—and the poor decision making by Bruce Arena in his second tenure as manager that sealed the team’s fate. However, if the United States had qualified, the World Cup would have likely been disastrous. A fresh start was required—which we got through the hirings of Ernie Stewart, Brian McBride, and manager Gregg Berhalter. Because of this, the question has been raised: how will the United States Men’s National Team lineup to qualify for 2022?

    <h13>
      It is impossible to tell right now. We still have two more January camps that could incorporate new players. January camp is important for the U.S. staff to analyze MLS players. This is how Klinsmaan discovered Graham Zusi, Omar Gonzalez, and Matt Besler—who all found themselves in Brazil in 2014.

    <h13>
      Because of this, the roster I will be creating will only incorporate players that have made a case as of now. Whether they have played in a national team game or not, what matters is if they have shown they can play first team minutes in intense environments. And for those players who have played for the U.S., how have they played? I’ll be going with a 4-3-3 formation. I think it is the safest for the United States and allows for changes to be made in game without disrupting the lineup's whole rhythm.

            Let’s start from the back. Goalkeeper has never been a weak spot for the U.S. We have been blessed with a history of great men in front of the net. I’m going with Zack Steffen as my starter. He is loud, experienced, and young. He plays first team minutes in the Bundesliga for Fortuna Düsseldorf, and his out performances against France gives him the edge. Brad Guzan would be my second-string. However, the likeliness of a mid-thirties, proven goalkeeper wanting to sit the bench again in a major tournament is low. If not, I would put in Bill Hamid. I think he is terrific in front of goal and would make a fine backup. Other young keepers like Ethan Horvath were in mind but seemed to under pressure.

    <h13>
      Starting at right back, I put Deandre Yedlin. He is quick, gets down the wing, and is improving his defensive game. Playing consistently in the Premier League for the past three to four years says something. Because of this, he gets the edge over Reggie Cannon and Nick Lima. Personally, I can see Cannon and Yedlin being head to head in the future, but Lima is far too average to ever start in 2022. Cannon will make the bench for his versatility. Berhalter could stick him on the right or left and he would do well.

    <h13>
      Center backs have been a questionable area ever since the likes of Carlos Bocanegra and Oguchi Onyewu exited the national team. I’m putting in Aaron Long and John Brooks. They have not played together too much, but I am safe with them leading the back line. Long is a leader, strong in the air, and very pacy. When healthy, Brooks is playing weekly in the Bundesliga and has proven to be the future of the U.S. back line. The only thing that worries me is their chemistry. Playing in different leagues and not knowing each other too well may cause confusion in the backline

          <h13>
            Walker Zimmerman is the next best option alongside Long. Zimmerman and Long seem to be close off the field: they are both MLS All Stars and always seem to banter with one another. However, I predict Zimmerman slowly falling off after his move to Nashville SC. I firmly believe LAFC, or Bob Bradley, had a huge impact on his presence in the national team. Matt Miazga would be on my bench for sure. Just like the others, he’s strong in the air and good with his feet. Miles Robinson is an up and comer also. He has a bright future and will be included in the future. However, his lack of experience as a center back with the full national team doesn’t put him in the squad. In the end it’s Long and Brooks as the starters.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>For the midfield three, I settled on Michael Bradley behind Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams. Bradley has his haters, I know. He was the captain in the loss to Trinidad. However, I think he still is one of the best midfielders we have ever produced. His criticism comes from setting a high bar for American midfielders. At one time he was starting over Totti at Roma and playing serious minutes in Serie A. He is not perfect by any means—and he’ll be 34 in 2022—but his leadership, experience, and presence in the midfield gives him the nod and will help nurture the likes of Adams and McKennie for the future.</h13>

    <h13>
      When discussing why I’ve chosen Adams and McKennie, I think it’s obvious. Both are playing for Bundesliga teams and are big contributors despite their young age. Their chemistry will contribute to success and give us confidence for years to come. If I were to pick a few midfield substitutes, it would be Ulysses Llanez, Sebastian Lletget, Paxton Pomykal, and Jackson Yueill. More creativity is needed in the midfield. Whenever we play games against Mexico, we tend to sit back and try to play off a counter attack. I recommend watching the 2013 U.S. vs. Mexico game at Azteca. The U.S. sits back the entire game and when we do get the ball in their half, we are outnumbered.

    <h13>
      One of Klinsmaan’s biggest mistakes was not to incorporate more creative players. Why do you think Tim Howard had to make 16 saves against Belgium. It’s because we hardly had the ball. We needed a Benny Feilhaber or Joe Corona to give us some flair. That’s what I believe all of these men can do. Llanzez is training with the Wolfsburg first team. He is a beast and should be included for his stellar January Camp. Lletget and Yuiell offer stability. Lletget can literally play anywhere. His left foot is just as good as his right, and he is a great substitute for that final 30 minute push. Pomykal will be in Europe soon and his game will grow. He’s a great talent that FC Dallas needs to monitor. Yuiell can be the Bradley of the future. He has been legit in every game he has played in for the U.S. and is a mainstay for the ever-evolving San Jose Earthquakes since he arrived from UCLA.

            The third spot up top may be the hardest. Paul Arriola has been a mainstay however his ACL injury may set him back. Jordan Morris has been a huge contributor to the U.S in recent years. He scores a lot of goals and we have relied on him in big games. He mostly delivers. I would love to say Gio Reyna is ready to start for the United States. He belongs in the squad for sure, but he still needs to make a debut. By 2022, he will be ready, but as of right now, he still needs experience. I’m putting him on the bench regardless. Timothy Weah is a good winger but currently injured. A future player in 2022 for sure but not for an upcoming qualifier. I’m going with Morris.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            For attacking-minded substitutes, Josh Sargent has proven his patience and for that reason, he will be a backup for Altidore. Gyasi Zardes is someone I am not a huge fan of, however Berhalter and he have a history in Columbus. I recently saw him play live when Columbus played Chicago Fire at SeatGeek Stadium. His touch was atrocious and he did not stand out as a national team caliber player. But he scores goals, so I’ll put him on the bench.

      Jonahtan Lewis is a x-factor mainly because of his versatility. His pace allows him to play as an advanced midfielder, winger, or striker. He works hard and seems to do well in Berhalter’s system. In humid games in Honduras or Panama, you need players who can run. Lewis makes the bench for me. Duane Holmes and Tyler Boyd have been dual-national sparks for the United States. They both bring flare and speed to the attack. Their experience in Europe shows and hopefully they develop chemistry with the rest of the team because I would love to have one of them on the bench. I’m going Boyd over Holmes for now though.

      I’ve rambled frequently throughout this piece, so here is my full lineup in one place:

      It will be interesting to see how Berhalter and his staff assess their player pool. If qualifying started tomorrow, I believe this is our strongest squad to go in and grind. The United States is a growing soccer nation so we need time to create a winning team. I believe this squad can be a springboard to do that.
