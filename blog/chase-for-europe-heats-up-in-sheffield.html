      <h12><b>Final Score: Sheffield United 3 - 1 Tottenham</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a heated battle that was potentially for this season’s final European spot, Tottenham struggled to break through Sheffield United’s tight defense, while the Blades put three past an underwhelming Spurs. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Sheffield Bounce Back with Excellent Display</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The restart had not been kind so far to Sheffield United. Despite going into the COVID break with a chance to jump Manchester United into fifth place, the Blades did not perform to their usual standards. A key injury to center back Jack O’Connell didn’t help, but the team as a whole just didn’t look themselves. After a strong showing against Arsenal in the FA Cup this past weekend, Sheffield seems to have got their groove back. Though Tottenham had much more of the ball, Sheffield looked infinitely better when they did get possession. The Blades did what they normally do - get the ball into wide areas and try to create overloads - but today they looked much sharper when doing so. Instead of lofting balls into the box when given space out wide, Sheffield tried to work the ball more into the half-spaces, and all three goals came from low cut-backs from these areas.

              Spurs may have been unlucky not to score an early equalizer after Harry Kane’s goal was disallowed by VAR due to a handball in the buildup - we’ll get to that - but they were lacking in the final third all match. Tottenham did find themselves in Sheffield’s third numerous times throughout the game but failed to create much in the way of good chances. Other than the late goal, Tottenham failed to register a shot from inside the six-yard box from open play - three came off of corners. Many times, they just seemed out of ideas about how to break down Sheffield United’s solid block, and either lost possession or took a very low percentage shot. With the wealth of attacking talent at their disposal, it’s amazing that Tottenham looked so lost when in the final third. This seemed like a game where a player like Christian Eriksen could have been extremely useful.

            <h10><b>3. VAR Tries To Steal The Spotlight Once Again</b></h10>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              It’s unfair to Sheffield United - who really put in a wonderful performance - that this will probably end up being the biggest talking point from this game. The situation in question happened shortly after the Blades’ first goal, when Lucas Moura drove forward, was brought down just outside the box, and the ball fell to Harry Kane who finished for what seemed like the equalizing goal. However, VAR took a look at it and decided that when Lucas fell, the ball ricocheted off his hand before falling for Kane and disallowed the goal. Perhaps the call was a bit harsh, but I think it could have gone either way - without hitting Lucas’s hand the ball wouldn’t have reached Kane and therefore no goal, but on the other hand, there is no apparent intent from Lucas to hit the ball. Would a goal there have changed the result? I’m not sure. Sheffield still looked much better than Spurs throughout the game, but perhaps a goal there gives Tottenham more confidence to find a way through. Whatever the case, like a self-obsessed child, VAR once again wanted to remind people that it still exists by trying to be the center of attention.

      <h10><b>4. Sander Berge Puts On A Show</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Norwegian midfielder put in a man of the match performance against Spurs, and it’s exactly the type of performance Sheffield was wanting from him when they paid €21.5 million for him in January. He was spectacular at both ends, winning three tackles and 7/9 duels (sofascore.com) and notching a goal and an assist. The attacking contributions were particularly lovely. For his goal, Chris Basham receives the ball just inside the penalty area on the right and cuts it back into the middle, Basham makes a nice run toward the ball which drags Lo Celso out of position, and Berge picks up the ball and finishes nicely at the far post. On the assist, Berge receives in a similar position to Basham for his goal. Son tries to push him to the goal line, but Berge does a nice sidestep to get by him and cuts it back to McBurnie for the third goal. It was an all-around excellent display from Sander Berge, and he’s definitely a player to keep an eye on going into next season.

      <h10><b>5. The Chase for Europe Heats Up with Six Games to Go</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
         Because Sheffield United took all three points, just three points separate the seventh-placed Blades and eleventh placed Everton. With one European spot left - though possibly two - the final six games will be an exciting race between Sheffield, Arsenal, Spurs, Burnley, and Everton to reach the mark. To make things more exciting, there are plenty of games between these teams for the rest of the way. Sheffield plays Burnley and Everton, Arsenal plays Spurs, and Spurs play Everton. Sheffield probably has the toughest schedule the rest of the way - at Burnley and Leicester and home against Wolves, Chelsea, and Everton - but the final European spot currently lies in their hands.
