    <h13>
      In a contest between two sides competing for European qualification, Arsenal came out on top at the Molineux. Goals from Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette sealed the three points for the Gunners.

    <h10><b>1. Arteta Puts on a Tactical Masterclass</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Wolves have arguably been in the best form in the Premier League since the restart, and given questions of the current Arsenal squad, it was always going to take a special performance from the Gunners to thwart their opponent. It was one of Arsenal’s best performances from a defensive standpoint in a very long time. The back-line and midfield stayed incredibly disciplined, moving together, and maintaining a tight shape. The three center-backs, David Luiz, Mustafi, and Kolasinac—who were collectively focused and reliable—stayed narrow and connected throughout the 90 minutes. The Gunners are the first side in the past month to keep Adama Traoré under control, which can be credited to personalized structure and tactics. Arteta instructed his players to double, sometimes triple up on Traoré, limiting his ability to burst down the line and cross to the deadly Raúl Jiménez. Arteta used all five of his substitutions, his final two, Joe Willock and Alexandre Lacazette, connecting for the second goal.

            Three days ago, 18-year-old Bukayo Saka signed a contract extension with Arsenal, committing his long-term future to his boyhood club. Today, Saka scored his first-ever Premier League goal, and in some style. He broke the deadlock in the 43’ on an exquisite volley from a cross from Kieran Tierney. His technique in the strike was flawless and he once again proved that he is one of the most promising youngsters in the Premier League, and possibly in the world. Saka has become a staple in Arteta’s Arsenal. He has demonstrated a rare versatility, being deployed at right-wing (where he played against Wolves), left-wing, left-back, and central-midfield. He is a truly special talent and is on pace to become a top player in the league.

    <h10><b>3. A Quiet Performance from Adama Traoré</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While we have become accustomed to man-of-the-match performances from Adama Traoré, tonight was an exception. With Arsenal sending two to three players to cover Traoré every time he got the ball, it was difficult for him to make a major impact. This raises an interesting question: Are Wolves too reliant on Adama Traoré?
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It seemed that Wolves were perfectly comfortable sitting back, absorbing pressure, and hoping that Traoré would rescue them through a moment of individual brilliance. However, that moment never came, and when Traoré was shut down, Wolves seemed to be shut down. If other teams begin to overload the left side against Wolves in the future, Nuno Espírito Santo will have to make some major tactical changes to compensate.
      Longer-term, the club must be prepared for <a href="https://michigansoccersociety.com/blog/how-adama-traore-fits-in-liverpool-and-his-potential-replacements" style="color:#25528f;"><u>life after superstar Adama Traoré.</u></a>

    <h10><b>4. Wolves May Have the Best Duo in England</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Although it was a quiet night from the strike partnership of Raúl Jiménez and Adama Traoré, the two forwards were still able to show flashes of brilliance in their link-up play. The two have connected for the most goals of any pairing in the league, and have likewise created the most chances. Traore’s dazzling pace and dribbling are complemented sweetly by Jimenez’s movement and prolific finishing, making them so dangerous and oftentimes unplayable when on the same page. Forget about Aubameyang/Lacazette, Salah/Mane, or Kane/Son: Jimenez/Traore could be the best duo in the league.

            When Bernd Leno was injured against Brighton, Arsenal fans covered their faces in horror. With all the club’s defensive issues, Leno was the only piece keeping it competitive. But backup goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez—Arsenal’s current longest-serving player—has taken advantage of the opportunity. In four starts, he has conceded only one goal and been an important component contributing to Arsenal’s recent run of form. He had a very strong performance against Wolves, saving everything that came his way and distributing the ball well. By no means does this mean that Leno’s starting spot is in jeopardy, but if anything, this experience will help Martínez secure a favorable move in one of the coming transfer windows.
