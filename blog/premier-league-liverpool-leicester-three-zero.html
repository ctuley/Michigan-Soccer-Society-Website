      <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool 3 - 0 Leicester City </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When Leicester City famously overcame the odds and won the 2015/16 Premier League title, people often forget that they only lost three out of their 38 Premier League games. Two of those three losses came, however, against the Gunner, their opponents last night. It had been 47 years since the Foxes downed Arsenal at their home and although it was a relatively uneventful game, it is one that will go down in the history books.

      <h10><b>1. There Is No ‘I’ In System</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Seldom have this Liverpool team gone into the game not being the bookie’s favourite, but last night there were many who made the argument that a relatively in-form Leicester team would be too much for a depleted Reds squad. Along with the loss of their top scorer to the coronavirus, Klopp and co. were missing key personnel in the defensive positions, with Virgil Van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Thiago and Jordan Henderson all absent. Such is the level of training and preparation that this Liverpool squad go through that players playing out of their position slotted in seamlessly and for the entirety of the 90 minutes, there wasn’t even a moment of hesitation from the Reds. The modern game seems to gravitate towards individuals, but Klopp has created a monster of a system at Anfield, such that even players playing in unknown territory know exactly what they are expected to do. Several teams in the modern era are plagued by constantly chopping and changing managers and philosophies and consistency is hard to come by. With Klopp contracted until 2024, the rest of the league should be scared. Very, very scared.

      <h10><b>2. Rodgers Missing Key Men</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It does seem a bit hypocritical to praise one team for doing well without key players, but then use that as an explanation for the performance of another team, but not everybody is Klopp and not every team is Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers has done an amazing job at Leicester and unlike many in the higher echelons of the Premier League, the club seems to be heading in the right direction. While last night was not evidence for that, it is difficult to be too critical of the Foxes, who are missing the likes of Wilfred Ndidi, Ricardo Pereira, Caglar Soyuncu as well as Timothy Castagne, who has been monumental at the start of this season. These are all important cogs in the Leicester team and while an improvement on their fifth place finish last year is difficult, there’s no reason why they cannot do it again. Judging them on their inability to beat Liverpool at Anfield is unfair. If that were the benchmark for every team, I’m afraid we’d have 19 bad teams in the top tier of English football.

      <h10><b>3. Andy Robertson, Take A Bow</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      It is difficult to pick out players, especially when there were good performances all over the place. There is one man, however, who deserves a lot more plaudits than he is currently deserving and that man is Andrew Robertson. While his entire backline finds themselves on the sidelines, Robertson has still been his energetic and relentless self throughout this very ‘special’ season. Add to his domestic exploits the fact that he has led his country to the Euros next summer only makes his performances more commendable. While his partner in crime, Trent Alexander-Arnold, endures a slow start to the season, Robertson has filled in seamlessly and is currently Liverpool’s highest assist provider in the league and added to his tally last night as he put in a picture perfect cross for Diogo Jota to latch onto. With an inexperienced and makeshift defense, the pressure will be on Roberston to be solid and deliver. However, if there was ever an embodiment of the saying, ‘When the going gets tough, the tough get going’, it would be the Scottish international.

      <h10><b>4. Best Frontline in Europe</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It took me some time to agree with my own statement, but I can confidently say that this Liverpool frontline can go toe to toe with any other in Europe. How many teams can lose their best frontman and still remain as dangerous? With Jota, Liverpool now have not just three, but four high quality frontmen and while a Salah or Mane injury last season could have been detrimental, Klopp can rest easy that he has an able deputy in their absence as well as a player who can provide genuine competition to their African duo. Their ability to deal with injuries and make something out of nothing (A Sadio Mane speciality, as I like to call it) is unrivalled. Most importantly for Liverpool fans, last night was the most encouraging performance from Bobby Firmino that the Anfield faithful have seen in a long time. Yes, he gets away with too much because no striker should miss the number of big chances he does, but there is truth to what Klopp says about him in the press. He has been an integral part of all their recent success, and imagine just what they could achieve if he actually started scoring goals...

      <h10><b>5. What Next For The Premier League?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        One look at the Liverpool bench is enough to tell you that no amount of squad depth is likely to be enough for Liverpool this season. If Liverpool are going to find it tough to deal with the fixture congestion and a global pandemic, what exactly are the rest of the league expected to do. James Milner might be the second greatest utility player that’s ever been (All hail John O’Shea), but the fact that he has to fill in at right back just doesn’t seem right. It does seem like the 5 sub rule will be introduced very soon, but that will offer little solace to managers as the English enter the dreaded festive period. It’s a pretty scathing description of what the current scenario is when Klopp expresses his concern that he won’t have 11 fit players to field by the end of the season and his candid remarks post game (conveniently cut out by Sky) will only heap pressure on the men in charge. Milner at right back, a record number of penalties so far, David Coote man of the match at Old Trafford and Tottenham Hotspur at the top of the Premier League table... what on Earth is going on!
