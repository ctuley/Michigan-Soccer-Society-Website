      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 0 - 0 Chelsea</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The two most successful clubs of the Premier League era are only two of the several European superpowers that have hired former players as their head coach. Frank Lampard and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have found it hard to stay out of the limelight as their clubs endured up and down seasons and as the new season gets into full swing, the doubters are making their voices heard. After a rainy night under the floodlights at Old Trafford, both teams raised more questions than they answered.

      <h10><b>1. The Talking Point</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Let’s just get it out of the way. If Harry Maguire’s potential foul on Cesar Azpilicueta. While even the most exciting of games nowadays are usually shrouded by VAR decisions, the fact that almost nothing else of note happened in the game made it that much more poignant. There isn’t much to say here. Is it a foul. Yes, I think it is, but then again, so is the incident between Reece James and Maguire minutes prior to the incident in question. What is frustrating is that a slight tap on Marcus Rashford’s shoes was reviewed for the better part of two minutes, while this decision seemed to be made within seconds. Surely Martin Atkinson should have been advised to consult the pitchside monitor, a sentiment echoed by Azpilicueta’s post match interview. These are exactly the kind of decisions VAR was brought in to make, not checking whether a player is offside by an armpit.

      <h10><b>2. Mendy, Final Nail in Kepa’s Coffin</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With the emergence of social media, ridiculing footballers has become easier, the means to do so more accessible and the amount of hate received has reached a ridiculous level. While Kepa’s mental wellbeing would surely have been tested in the last 12 months as every single person in the industry laid into him, this might just be one of the rare times the internet has not blown something out of proportion. Besides the personal insults of course, everything said about Kepa is relatively accurate. He is unable to make saves, his only portrayal of authority was during extra time of the Carabao Cup final in the 18/19 season and before this gameweek, 20% of all the individual errors leading to goal this season came from the man himself. Edouard Mendy, the man brought in to bring some amount of sanity to the goalposts at Stamford Bridge, eased a few nerves with his performance last night (except for that time he almost decided to tuck the ball into the bottom corner of his own net). While it wasn’t an extraordinary performance, he made three commendable saves, two of which prevented the man in form, Marcus Rashford. A good save with his feet just after the half hour mark was followed up by a flying save to deny the Englishman on the 90th minute mark. It might be unfair on the Spaniard, but it is hard to imagine a world where Kepa keeps both those shots out. Rashford might have been shutting down Tory MPs all week, but Mendy would remain unmoved. More importantly, it seems unlikely that Petr Cech will have to dawn the goalkeeper gloves anytime soon.

      <h10><b>3. What Is A Kai Havertz?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It is hard to pickout a standout performance from this game. Fred displayed another solid performance, as did the aforementioned Mendy. However, it was easy to point out which players were relatively ineffective. German duo Timo Werner and Kai Havertz gave the United defense no problems at all. While Werner’s role is easier to define, fans have been scratching their head as to how Lampard wants to set up his midfield, especially those playing higher up the pitch. Chelsea have had a summer to remember, but it will be remembered for all the wrong reasons if Lampard and his team cannot get these players to play well together. As of now, it is difficult to see what Havertz’s role is and where he will play in the long run. Ziyech is likely to share the majority of the creative burden cutting in from the right, while there is no real reason to displace Pulisic from his strongest left wing spot. Havertz and Mount, the two players vying for the number ten role (presuming Lampard sticks to a 4-2-3-1), are extremely different, and one could argue that Mount’s qualities offer a better balance to the team. It’s still early days and fans shouldn’t be too quick to judge, but should Lampard take a page from Solskjaer’s book based on how he has handled the introduction of Donny Van De Beek, or will the Norwegian go on to regret not giving him more minutes sooner?

      <h10><b>4. Plenty To Prove</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Let’s make it clear. Both coaches have a lot left to prove. While there are benefits to having a club legend at the helm, the downsides are there for everyone to see. None of the evidence suggests that either Lampard or Solskjaer know how to perfectly coach and organise a defense. Both teams' defensive problems have dotted their opening games so far, and last night it looked like the only solution both coaches had was numbers at the back. Even though signings like Thiago Silva and Harry Maguire are meant to help in this regard, it almost seems like they are expected to have a Van Dijk-esque influence on the team. Thrusting the captaincy on both of the aforementioned is just one example of how dependent the team is expected to be on these individuals. Both teams, even United, despite their average summer, are filled with superstars and it is a Herculean task to get them all playing at the highest level together, but that will not gain both managers any sympathy. Many things could go wrong, but this could very well be the undoing of Frank Lampard and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

      <h10><b>5. Both Teams Happy With A Point…?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There was a sense of acceptance at the end of the game. Both, the managers and the players, seemed to be happy with a point. While United did pick up the pace once the substitutions were made, the intensity and urgency was never there. Chelsea were happy to defend in numbers and were set up to stop United’s attack rather than to supply their own. With the goals, especially the kind of goals both teams had been shipping, it is understandable that a clean sheet was sorely needed. However, neither team was on their game and the result was there for the taking. Alas, a historically entertaining fixture failed to do so this time around. Maybe we’ve just been spoiled, but this was honestly a dreadful watch. Both teams have high aspirations and even higher expectations this season. They’re going to have to hope that a lot of things go their way for those to be matched. Just to start them of, here’s Tip #1 for Solskjaer: Maybe don’t start Daniel James in big games… or any game at all.
