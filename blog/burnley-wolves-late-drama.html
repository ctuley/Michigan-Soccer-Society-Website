      <h12><b>Final Score: Burnley 1 - 1 Wolves</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        An exciting game was expected on Wednesday, as Burnley and Wolves were both likely to go for a win to aid their chances of European qualification. It took until the last 15 minutes, but we eventually got the kind of riveting drama that we wanted. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Lack Of Extra Quality In Final Third Hurts Wolves</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Wolves had plenty of chances during the game. Unfortunately, most of them weren’t particularly good chances. An early corner brought the game’s best chance, but Romain Saiss could not direct his header on target from close range - a theme that would come back later in this game. Despite the likes of Adama Traore and Diogo Jota consistently progressing the ball into dangerous areas, Wolves just couldn’t seem to find that final ball - instead opting for shots from long range or wide areas. Part of this was due to Burnley’s excellent defense, but apart from Traore blowing past defenders to cross in from the byline, Wolves looked out of ideas when in the final third. Burnley were caught out many times on counterattacks, but indecision from the Wolves forwards allowed Burnley to get back in their shape and force bad shots that were either blocked or directed right at Pope. Wolves will need to create better chances in their last two games if they want to guarantee playing in Europe next season.

      <h10><b>2. Despite More Injuries, Dyche’s Men Fight Back For A Point</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        A first half injury to Charlie Taylor further depleted an already paper-thin squad, but Burnley did not back down. Wolves set up to pin Burnley back by fielding Adama Traore as one of the wingbacks, and having him and Ruben Vinagre push far up and almost form a front five to overload Burnley’s backline. While this worked for much of the game - Traore specifically being very dangerous when finding space on the right - Sean Dyche’s team were able to create chances through counterattacks when Wolves left themselves too exposed and set pieces when Wolves were forced into fouling to stop the counters. Burnley defended well, and were unlucky to be unlocked by a wondergoal from Raul Jimenez, but they kept pressing for an equalizer. The moment came in the form of a free header into an open net for Chris Wood, but he put it wide. Burnley didn’t let this get them down, and continued to press for an equalizer, which they got via a penalty in the last minute of the game. Chris Wood finished it off, and the game ended 1-1.

      <h10><b>3. Chris Wood Redeems His Late Miss With Equalizing Penalty</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Everybody loves a good redemption story, but it usually takes longer than two minutes for the main character to actually redeem themselves. Chris Wood was shown the perfect opportunity to score an equalizer for Burnley in the 93rd minute. Matej Vydra was able to draw Wolves defenders out and get a cross past Rui Patricio to where Wood was standing, unmarked, with an open net. Equalizers don’t come much easier than that. The player who has scored so many headed goals for Burnley over the last few seasons somehow couldn’t direct the header on target. But, when most players would have given up, Wood kept pushing for a goal. In the 95th minute, a cross was put into the box and Wood tried a bicycle kick for what surely would have been the goal of the season. But he didn’t make contact with the ball. Thankfully for him, Matt Doherty’s arm did, and a penalty was awarded. Wood stepped up to take, fired the ball into the top corner, and the redemption arc was completed.

      <h10><b>4. Brilliant Jimenez Goal Brings Him To 20 For The Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although Wolves had plenty of chances early in the game, it took a bit of luck and a moment of brilliance to find their opener. The goal came in the 75th minute from a counterattack started by Adama Traore driving through Burnley’s midfield like an NFL running back breaking tackles. Traore laid it off for substitute Matt Doherty, who promptly shot from well outside the box and seemed to ruin the attack altogether. But, like something out of a FIFA video game, the blocked shot fell right to Raul Jimenez just inside the box, who volleyed the shot past Nick Pope and put Wolves up 1-0. Jimenez has been excellent the last two seasons, and took his tally for this campaign up to 20 goals in all competitions with that magnificent strike. Perhaps if he wasn’t 29 already he would get a bit more love from around the league, but for now he’ll just have to settle for being one of the league’s most underrated players.

      <h10><b>5. Draw Hurts European Hopes Of Both Clubs</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Unfortunately for Burnley, a draw in this game - coupled with the results of other games on Wednesday - likely ended their hopes of playing in the Europa League for the second time in three seasons. Though this is probably for the best given the complete lack of depth that they have at the moment, it still would have been a fun ride for the Burnley fans. Wolves, on the other hand, remain in a European qualification spot at the moment. However, with Tottenham and Arsenal winning and Sheffield having a game in hand, their chances at a second consecutive season in Europe are looking as worse than they have in a while. On the bright side for Wolves, qualifying is completely in their hands going into the final two games. Taking care of business against Crystal Palace and Chelsea will see them go on another European adventure.
