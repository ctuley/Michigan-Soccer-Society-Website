      <h10>Liverpool Prove Too Much as They Glide Past Arsenal

      <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool FC 3-1 Arsenal FC</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      In a fixture that has seen Arsenal emerge victorious in the previous two matches, Liverpool prove they are still unbeatable at Anfield. In a game that saw Arsenal take the lead early, Liverpool’s dominance showed that when the Reds have something to play for, very few sides can beat them.

      <h10><b>1. Arsenal In Need of Reinforcements</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      Arsenal did not play so much of a terrible game as the Reds bossed Arsenal with class, barring two moments of greatness from Lacazette. The Gunners employed their playing out from the back style that has been primarily implemented since Arteta came in as manager. It has looked fairly effective so far, snatching two wins from Liverpool, one against City, and the FA Cup final from Chelsea. However, the clear focus for Arsenal when matching up against quality sides is passing around the back, leading to an eventual ball over the top to Aubameyang. This tends to exclude the midfield due to the lack of talent for Arsenal within that unit on the pitch. Arsenal had found slight success with the duo of Ceballos and Xhaka, but it is clear that there is a definite missing element of creative prowess within that midfield and the ability to move the ball forward. This is why the potential transfer of either Partey, Aouar, or possibly both is crucial if Arsenal wish to contend for top 4 in the Premier League.

      <h10><b>2. Liverpool Look Like Clear Favorites to Repeat</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Liverpool may have looked shaky in their opening game of the season, but after beating a Chelsea side injected with expensive signings and an Arsenal side brimming with optimism under a new boss, Liverpool has begun to pick up where they left off before the pandemic delayed the 2019-20 season. With their great success in the season so far and a Manchester City side that looked ragged in a 5-2 defeat against Leicester at the weekend, there is no doubt that Liverpool are the team to beat once again this year. If the Reds push forward with their momentum as they did last year, one must worry that Liverpool have a definite chance to create an insurmountable lead at the top of the table early in the season, especially if they can escape the Etihad with a victory on November 7th.

      <h10><b>3. Arsenal Back Three Running Out of Steam</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Since Mikel Arteta has been in charge, the most success Arsenal has found, specifically against teams in the “Big 6”, has been with the back three that morphs into a back four on the attack. However, it may be beginning to slowly lose effectiveness. With this formation the main focus for Arsenal is to pass around the back and try to play balls past the midfield straight to the front three, or carry the ball forward through the fullbacks, usually avoiding the midfield as a source of creation. The main connection established by Arsenal was Tierney playing the ball over the top of the defence to a running Aubameyang. This style struggles to get results against the more defensive sides, such as West Ham last week, but this strategy is, in theory, more effective against stronger sides. The issue is that dominant sides, Like Liverpool, are quickly adapting to these tactics as they are used more frequently against them. It also is difficult for the forwards to find any attacking space when their opposing center-backs are Gomez and Van Dijk, defenders who can keep up with the fastest attackers in the league. Although the Arsenal back three has provided some success and protection for the Gunners under Arteta, it may be time to sacrifice the defensive stability for another creative option within the midfield.

      <h10><b>4. Jota On the Rise for Liverpool</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Portuguese international player got his first Liverpool minutes under his belt after signing from Wolves for £41 million. The 23 year-old came on for Sadio Mané, the man of the match, in the 79th minute. With a front three that looks too deadly to take off the field, Jota has to prove himself if he wants to see any play time. Within his eleven minute appearance Jota had multiple great scoring opportunities, the first in which Salah made a skillful solo run across the top of the 18 yard box leading to a tantalizing ball that Jota barely missed. The second being a cross that was falling kindly to him only for Salah to run in and scuff the ball. The final opportunity for Jota came after an Alexander-Arnold cross that was unconvincingly headed away by David Luiz, leading to a control and volley that Jota made no mistake with by burying it into the bottom left corner. Jota is looking to be a clear solution to Liverpool’s lack of attacking depth. There will certainly be less concern with an injury to one of Liverpool’s star players if there is a player of Jota’s quality ready to come in and do his job again.

      <h10><b>5. Next Two Months Crucial for Arsenal</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With two wins and a loss to start the season, Arsenal are in an interesting position. With an incredibly difficult schedule in the coming days, the points Arsenal attain (or don’t attain) in the coming days are going to be a good tell as to how their season is going to finish. Starting with today’s match, Arsenal have begun a five game stretch that includes four of the top five clubs from last season, only excluding Chelsea. Even the fifth game will be a challenge against a Sheffield United team that surprised the league last season and can always grind out a result. With this tough stretch, Arsenal need to be careful and not to fall into the same traps as last season. The beginning of this season looks eerily similar to the start of last season where Arsenal fans seem to be very optimistic, and the results seem nearly the same. The first game for Arsenal last year was a convincing win vs Newcastle while this season they began with a convincing win against Fulham. Last year they began the season with a less convincing 2-1 win vs Burnley, while this season they followed their win against Fulham with an unconvincing 2-1 vs West Ham. Finally, the greatest coincidence, the third game of both seasons have been 3-1 losses to Liverpool at Anfield. Last year following the 3-1 loss to the Reds, Arsenal only won 2 games out of their next 12 matches leading to the eventual firing of Unai Emery. Although there is clearly more trust within the Arsenal community in Arteta compared to Emery, this does stress how important these next few games are as the poor form they struggled with last year sent them to tenth, falling 10 points behind Champions League contention.
