      <h12><b>Final Score: Tottenham 2-0 Arsenal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Fans were finally present at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium yesterday to watch Mourinho’s side face Arsenal in a North London Derby. With the Gunners and Spurs starting the game at 14th and 3rd respectively in the table, it was the meeting of a side very in-form and one quite the opposite. A goal and an assist for both Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son gave the home side a first-half lead that they saw out for the following 45 minutes with relative ease. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

      <h10><b>1. Kane-Son Combo Firing on All Cylinders</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Jose Mourinho has solid gold on his hands with his current attacking partnership of Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son. With 31 goal contributions between the two and no signs of slowing down, these two forwards are on pace for unheard of numbers as the season progresses. Combining both pace and precision, the Korean sensation Son has cemented himself as one of the best wingers in world football, showing just how lethal he can be with a sensational curler past Leno in their match yesterday. Right next to him, Harry Kane has blossomed into the best striker in English football and is on pace to set a new record for goal contributions in a Premier League season if he can keep this level of play up. With the likes of Liverpool, Leicester, and Wolves still to face this month, these two forwards will be vital to the success of Spurs and could elevate them further at the top of the league.

      <h10><b>2. Arteta Under Fire as Arsenal Fall to 15th</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It is a bad time to be Mikel Arteta right now as it appears as though nothing can go right in their domestic games. Having won just 1 of their last 7 in the premier league and scoring only 2 goals in that span, it is an understatement to say that they are not in the form they would like to be. While some fans choose to hold on to hope, much of the backlash has been directed towards manager Mikel Arteta, who came in last year when the team was sitting 8th in the league. After winning both the FA Cup and the Community Shield last season, Arteta was riding high coming into the start of the new season. New signings gave fans hope for a run at the title, however, it appears that a fight for relegation is more likely if they continue to play like they are currently. On a more positive note, the Gunners qualified for the next round of the Europa League on Thursday and netted four goals in the process. The team clearly has the talent, it will be interesting to see if Arteta can bring it out of them in their domestic matches.

      <h10><b>3. Tottenham Defense Looking Better Than Ever</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Keeping yet another clean sheet, Toby Alderweireld and company have developed into a formidable backline in the Premier League. With the additions of left-back Sergio Reguilon and holding midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg this season, Mourinho seems to have perfected his defensive scheme, having not allowed a goal in English competition since the first of November. A massive part of their success is due to the hard work put in by the likes of Hojbjerg and his fellow defensive midfielder Moussa Sissoko, both of whom have been outstanding players this season and fill in any holes left by their backline. Watching this defensive unit move together appears seamless most of the time, rarely calling goalkeeper Lloris into action to cover their blunders. As Tottenham look forward to their matches, the likes of Mo Salah and Jamie Vardy will be serious tests for this backline who hope to continue their success as they push for a title this season.

      <h10><b>4. Rare Partey Start Overshadowed by Injury</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        One of Arsenal’s biggest signings of the summer, midfielder Thomas Partey, found himself in the starting eleven yesterday, a big game for him to cement his spot in the lineup. Despite putting in a rather solid performance, Partey’s day came to a rather unfortunate end as he walked off the pitch injured, leaving his position vacant for the time being and allowing for Spurs to exploit the space and score their second goal. He was subsequently substituted, marking even more time missed this season due to a thigh strain that has caused Partey to miss the better half of November. Having cost the club $55 million in transfer fees, expectations were set rather high for the defensive midfielder. He touted much success with Atletico Madrid in previous seasons and could prove to be a crucial member of the Gunners’ midfield if he can stay fit. It will be just a matter of time now to assess how serious his injury was and estimate a timeline for his return, however, this Arsenal side needs all the help they can get if they are to turn the season around.

      <h10><b>5. What Happened to Aubameyang?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Possibly the most surprising thing to come out of the Premier League this season is the performance of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Following back-to-back seasons with 22 goals including a golden boot award in 2018/19, the Gabon international has netted just two goals in 11 games. This drop in form is undoubtedly affecting his team’s performance, as Aubameyang is by far their most prolific attacker. Perhaps it is just a cold streak, however, Arteta needs to figure out what he has to do to get his star striker back to scoring goals, even if he just needs a penalty to see the ball hit the back of the net again. If Arsenal hope to get back into contention for spots in Champions League next season, they need Aubameyang to perform. Call me crazy, but I don’t think it would hurt to have a creative outlet like Mesut Ozil on the pitch to feed him balls in behind.
