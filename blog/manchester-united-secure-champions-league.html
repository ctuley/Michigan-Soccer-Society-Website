    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It was a tight and nervy affair at the King Power Stadium in a game which was essentially a playoff for the Champions League spots with United a single point ahead of Leicester entering the final day. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard carried the Red Devils to victory. Here are five key takeaways:

            Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has led a rebuild of Manchester United after Jose Mourinho’s departure. His tenure has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride but since the purchase of Fernandes in January the Red Devils have been flying. The return of Paul Pogba from injury after the restart propelled United into top four position for the first time since fall of 2019.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Manchester United appear to be on the upswing with an exciting group of attackers and young prospects around the field. People are beginning to ask if United is ready to challenge for a title, not to rain on anybody’s parade but the gap between the top two of Liverpool and Manchester City and the rest of the league is staggering.
            The Red Devil’s defense is still questionable at times and they will need a new center back to pair with Harry Maguire and possibly a new left back as well to compete for titles.
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Solskjaer has done a good job of developing youth and letting talent shine but I don’t think he will be the manager to lead United to a Premier League title. The philosophy and discipline exhibited by Liverpool and Manchester City are levels above United. Solskjaer has built a good foundation for the club by simplifying things, but for United to take the next step they will have to eventually change managers.

    <h10><b>2. Leicester Feeble In Attack</b></h10>
    <br></br>



          <h13>
            The Foxes have dealt with long term injuries this season to James Maddison, Ben Chilwell, Ricardo Pereira and Christian Fuchs. That group along with the suspended Caglar Soyuncu was unavailable for the match. Manager Brendan Rodgers elected to go with a 3-5-2 formation with Hamza Choudhury, Youri Tielemans and Wilfred Ndidi making up the midfield trio. I was surprised to see Leicester play two defensively minded midfielders in Choudhury and Ndidi considering they needed to win this game. Obviously injuries limited Rodgers’ choices but a more creative presence could have been had by starting Dennis Praet instead of Choudhury. Choudhury also had the heavy touch and turnover that led to United’s first goal.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            The onus was on the Foxes to attack, they created 12 chances and had 14 total shots but they had zero big chances and only mustered three shots on target. They sorely missed Maddison’s creative threat and the forward pairing of Kelechi Iheanacho and Jamie Vardy struggled with the lack of service. This Leicester team was not their strongest squad but I was surprised by the lack of urgency displayed. They simply never looked threatening in attack.

    <h10><b>3. Jadon Sancho to Old Trafford?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      By securing the Champions League, Manchester United have positioned themselves well both on and off the pitch. Their European qualification will allow them to attract high profile players such as Jadon Sancho and will continue their status as one of the world’s richest clubs.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The investment in Bruno Fernandes seemed to change the club from top to bottom. There seemed to be a buzz around the club that hadn’t existed since the signings of Pogba and Romelu Lukaku. Buying Sancho could provide a similar boost for next season. Adding the 20-year-old Englishman would give United arguably the deepest and best group of forwards in the Premier League.
    <h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The investment in Sancho will be costly but in order to win a Premier League title you need that type of depth and talent. The table appears to be set for Sancho to move, now it’s up to Borussia Dortmund and United’s hierarchy to hash out a deal.

        <h13>
          This season may be remembered with a bitter taste for Leicester fans because of how close they were to playing Champions League football, but their late season collapse shouldn’t overshadow the job Rodgers has done in the Midlands. Considering Rodgers was forced to start 35-year-old Wes Morgan today, securing European football is extremely impressive. A 9th place finish last season didn’t foreshadow what was going to happen this season. Rodgers had the Foxes neck and neck with Manchester City early in the season and they played some of the most attractive football in the division with possession and panache.
        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          Rodgers also helped revitalize the 33-year-old Vardy as a player.  Rodgers transformed the poacher into an all-round striker who won the Golden Boot with 23 goals this season. Leicester are positioned well going into next season with a crop of young talent including Ben Chilwell, Caglar Soyuncu, Demarai Gray, Harvey Barnes, Youri Tielemans, Wilfred Ndidi, Justin James and Luke Thomas. The Foxes will be able to extract large sums of money if other clubs buy their talent (see Harry Maguire) to invest in replacements. A 5th place finish secures Europa League group stage play for next season. European football will be back at the King Power Stadium for the first time since the 2016/17 season. This added financial stability should allow Leicester to continue to challenge the traditional top-six and attract higher profile players.

    <h10><b>5. Let the Fun Begin...</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The end of the Premier League season simply means another season is starting: the transfer window. The window officially opens Monday July 27th and will conclude on October 5th. Strap yourself in Leicester and United fans this transfer window could have a dizzying amount of activity and more links than you can count.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Leicester will likely be a selling club this window but don’t expect them to part easily with their players, as seen with Riyad Mahrez, they are more than content to wait for buying clubs to meet their price. United’s Sancho deal could conclude shortly and I expect them to be in the market for several other players in defense and midfield. Even if the Red Devils aren’t interested in many players there will certainly be rumors floating around in the ether, as agents try to inflate the value of their client by saying high profile clubs are interested.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The summer transfer window is one of my favorite times of the year. Fans can feel like their team is winning (or losing) even though no games are being played. The social media rumors and speculation only adds to the fun. There will be many frantic internet searches by fans trying to find out who the player is that their club signed or to see which rumors are being passed around. This time of the year can be just as influential to a season as the actual games. A title can’t be won in the offseason but it can be lost.
