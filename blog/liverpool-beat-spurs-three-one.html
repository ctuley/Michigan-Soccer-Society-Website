      <h12><b>Final Score: Final Score: Tottenham 1-3 Liverpool</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both teams came into this match in rough patches of form. Despite being in the top two places in their last meeting, six games later Liverpool and Tottenham found themselves fighting to stay in the title race they were at one point leading. The Reds ended up breaking out of their rough patch first a cruised to a 3-1 win. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. If You Create Enough, Eventually You Will Score</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite having the best offense in the league by expected goals, an unlucky run of bad finishing meant Liverpool came into this game having scored just one goal in their last five league games since they put seven past Crystal Palace. However, panic was not required because as long as they kept creating chances at the same rate, they would eventually find the back of the net. We got a taste of it last weekend when they scored twice in their FA Cup match against Manchester United, but they still needed to have it translate to league play. Liverpool played their normal game against Tottenham, creating a ton of chances and leaving the rest up to luck. Early on, it seemed like another one of those days where the finishing would not be there and Hugo Lloris was going to have a big day in goal. But, thankfully for Liverpool, they broke through just before halftime and never looked back. Liverpool finished with three goals from 2.59 xG (understat.com) and it looks like they might be back on track.

      <h10><b>2. Tottenham Look Lost Offensively Without Harry Kane</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        As soon as Harry Kane had to come off at halftime with an injury, there was no chance Spurs were going to get back in the game. He was the focal point of Tottenham’s attack in the first half - as he has been all season - and as Liverpool’s attack started to heat up in the second half, Jose Mourinho’s team were left behind. They generated just a single shot in the second half - a low percentage opportunity outside the box that Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg somehow turned into a goal - and failed to even get the ball in threatening positions. If Kane’s injury is serious, Tottenham could be in deep trouble because, while the striker depth is a bit better than usual, Harry Kane has been by far Spurs’ best offensive player and biggest offensive play driver. With how little Tottenham usually create, they need someone who can finish off the few chances they get a game. Nobody in their squad does that better than Harry Kane.

      <h10><b>3. Potential Matip Injury Could Spell More Trouble For Thin Liverpool Defense</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Tottenham were not the only ones with halftime injury issues. For much of this season, Liverpool have been forced to play with a back four that wouldn’t look out of place as a flat-four midfield. Joel Matip had come back just in time to replace the injured Fabinho who had been filling in at centerback, but at halftime he was forced to come out with another injury. It may have been precautionary, but if that is not the case Liverpool will be running with midfielder Jordan Henderson and a not-very-good Nat Phillips in central defense. Phillips was not put under much pressure by Spurs in this one, but in one of his few moments of defending in the second half he was shown a yellow card for a reckless tackle. This could get ugly for Liverpool, but their elite offense should be able to do enough to carry them.

      <h10><b>4. Change The Offside Rule Already</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If VAR has done one thing right, it is point out how dumb the offside rule currently is. A second minute Son Heung-min goal was disallowed after he was shown to be offside in the buildup to the goal. By the rule, it was the right call, but should it be the right call? What advantage does Son get from having his heel and inch offside with his back to goal? The answer is none, no argument the other way. We have seen dumb stuff like this since VAR was introduced last season. Players’ arms (body parts that cannot even be used to touch the ball) have been called offsides, gaps invisible to the naked eye have been called offside, centimeters have been the difference between plenty of goals and free kicks. It makes no sense, and the rule needs to be changed in some way if they are going to stick with VAR (which they will).

      <h10><b>5. Liverpool Are Still In This Title Race</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Assuming Manchester City win their game in hand, Liverpool will be seven points back of first place with half a season left to play. While City do look unstoppable at the moment, Liverpool are very much still in this title race. They have a hugely important run of game coming up with 5th place in-form West Ham away, 1st place Manchester City, and 3rd place Leicester City away all in their next four games. They may need to take all nine points from those games, but do not count the Reds out just yet. With their offense, anything is possible.
