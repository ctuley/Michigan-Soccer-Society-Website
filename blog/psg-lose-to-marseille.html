      <h12><b>Final Score: PSG 0-1 Marseille</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After losing their Ligue 1 opener to Lens on September 10, PSG faced off against rivals Marseille in “Le Classique”. In what was a scrappy game that had a total of 5 red cards, Marseille beat PSG to send the Ligue 1 giants into a scramble. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Neymar Needs To Stay Calm</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In Neymar’s first game for Paris since the Champions League Final, he did not look like the playmaker the team knows he is. Neymar totaled six shots but only one was on target, and once Marseille took the lead he started becoming more and more frustrated. Towards the end of the game (the last few minutes), Neymar got into a few scuffles that ultimately led to him being sent off, along with Layvin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes. After the game, he blamed it on a racial slur, as someone supposedly called him a “monkey motherf---er”. If this is true, his reaction may have been warranted, but Neymar needs to be more calm and control his emotions when things get heated. We saw the same thing happen last year and that is when the critics started coming in.

      <h10><b>2. Florian Thauvin Is Officially Back</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Thauvin, after making his first start in 15 months due to an Arthroscopie against Brest, played the part again against a much better team. Thauvin had the only goal of the match and lifted Marseille to a crucial victory this early in the season. This continues his good form, as against Brest he had a goal and two assists. Thauvin has looked fresh and has been causing trouble for the defenses all the teams he played against so far, and he, Maxime Lopez, and Dimitri Payet are looking like an extremely talented front three for Marseille this season.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>3. PSG Have A Center-back Problem</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Thiago Silva is officially a member of Chelsea, and this meant that PSG had to find a new center back to take his place. Their current answer for this is Thilo Kehrer, and he has played fine but his true position is a right-back. He does not have the frame nor the strength to play center-back, and on crosses, he looks lost. Many blame him for Kingsley Coman’s goal in the Champions League Final, and defending crosses is one of his worst attributes. Presnel Kimpembe also did not look good enough. He just is not a number one center-back. He played well with Thiago Silva but has not developed enough to be the leader of the defense, and you could see that on Thauvin’s goal. Kimpembe lost a step and he got punished. PSG need to move Kehrer back to the outside and find a new center-back.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. Steve Mandanda Keeps On Showing Why He Is Great</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        PSG did have their chances in the game, and Madanda stood up to most of them. He had a save on Marco Veratti from point-blank range and was always on his toes. He was rewarded a clean sheet and at 35 years old, Mandanda keeps showing why he is one of the best French goalkeepers. While he is not the starter on the national team, he deserves his place and provides a steady backbone for any team he plays for.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>5. Kylian Mbappe Needs To Stay Healthy</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        This is an obvious one. Mbappe has to isolate after contracting COVID-19, but even last year, PSG is a completely different team when he is on the field. For example, Atalanta was up 1-0 in the Champions League quarters until Mbappe came on and changed the whole game. Against Marseille, Pablo Sarabia was not great, and Mbappe could have made more of an offensive impact. He is one of the best players in the world, but health has been an issue recently, and in what might be his last season for the French giants they need him.
