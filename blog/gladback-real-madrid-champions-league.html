    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 2-0 Borussia Monchengladbach</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Two Karim Benzema goals lifted Real Madrid over Borussia Monchengladbach in what was a must-win game for the Merengues. Both teams will advance to the Champions League round of 16, with Real Madrid topping the group with 10 points and Gladbach on 8. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

            The Frenchman really showed up in what was Madrid’s biggest game of the season, and he won the game for his side. He found the back of the net twice with two headers- the first from a Lucas Vazquez cross and the second from Rodrygo (who had his best performance of the season against Gladbach). Benzema could have easily put up 5 goals against the Germans, as he had two more headers from close range that were stopped by Yann Sommer, and a volley that hit the crossbar. It’s good to see Benzema hit the ground running after only returning from injury on Saturday, and Madrid fans will hope that he can replicate his performance against Gladbach again next Saturday in the Madrid Derby.

    <h10><b>2. Luka Modric Turns Back The Clock</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite Benzema scoring twice against Gladbach, Modric was my man of the match. He bossed the midfield, completing 84 of 89 passes (94%), completed 4 dribbles, and registered 3 shots, including 1 that hit the post. He also scored a goal late in the first half, but it was called back due to Rafael Varane being offside on the assist. He ran around the field for 90 minutes like a madman, something that should not be capable of a 35 year-old. Real Madrid is a completely different team when Modric is playing at his best, and Real Madrid should be looking to extend his contract another year or two, as his current contract expires at the end of this current season.

    <h10><b>3. Gladbach Just Couldn’t Finish Their Chances</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Borussia Monchengladbach never really looked like they were going to win this match, but they did have a few chances. Alassane Plea had the best of Gladbach’s chances, as he broke free on Madrid’s goal in the 24th minute. Thibaut Courtois ruined the effort, however, as he excellently positioned himself so that Plea’s chip shot went just wide. Had that shot gone in, it would have been a 1-1 match, completely changing the game. Other than that move, Gladbach didn’t create too many other good chances in the match, as Madrid typically held the ball in the Germans’ half (Madrid had 64% possession).

    <h10><b>4. ...But They Won’t Mind Too Much</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite their loss to Real Madrid, Gladbach are still through to the Champions League Round of 16. To progress out of the so-called “group of death” is huge for Marco Rose and his men, and I’m very interested to see how they do in the next round. They finished second in the group, meaning that they will come up against one of Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, PSG, or Juventus, all which would be incredibly tough challenges for the Germans. However, Marco Rose is an expert tactician, and I have no doubt that he’ll use the extensive break until the next round to get his team prepared for their opponents.

    <h10><b>5. This Win Means More For Real Madrid Than Just A Round of 16 Appearance</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      This win was huge for Los Blancos, and not just because it saved them from the humiliation of playing in the Europa League. This means that Zidane will most likely not be sacked, regardless of how Madrid perform in this weekend’s derby. Zidane has led his side to two wins (with the third pending) in Real Madrid’s toughest week of their season (facing Sevilla, Gladbach, and Atletico Madrid). Zidane staying at the club is also huge for Sergio Ramos, as it was reported earlier this week that Madrid’s captain would not sign a contract extension if Zidane was sacked. This means that Madrid will most likely retain the two most important figures at the club, which is pivotal, as a forced transition period right now could ruin their season.
