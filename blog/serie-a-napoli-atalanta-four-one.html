      <h12><b>Final Score: Napoli 4 - 1 Atalanta </b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Two heavyweights of the Italian game locked horns on a beautiful evening in Naples as the Stadio San Paolo prepared itself for Gasperini’s men. Both teams came into the game having faced contrasting fortunes. Gattuso’s men, who have silenced their critics recently, were docked 1 point and handed a 3-0 loss to Juventus after failing to be available for their clash against the Old Lady due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in their camp. Atalanta, on the other hand, have become the first team in Serie A history to score four goals in their first three games and have started this season just how they finished the previous one. Last night, however, was Napoli’s night to hit four as they climbed to fourth on the table with a statement victory.

      <h10><b>1. Gatusso’s Galiant Gil Azzurri </b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Napoli have gone a little under the radar in recent times. Champions Juventus are always under the limelight, Inter have seen their stock rise dramatically as Conte works his magic (and signs about a million fullbacks. Whatever Pep can do, he can do better), Atalanta themselves have won the hearts of fans across the world and when Zlatan Ibrahimovic is back in town, can the spotlight really be on anyone else? Add to that their disappointing season last year, and you couldn’t blame anyone for overlooking them. This season, however, along with being a potent attacking side, they have conceded the third least goals in the Serie A this year. They’ve held onto their key players, brought in new talent and are playing with the kind of flair that has been missing in recent times. More importantly, their grit, aggression and bite makes them an embodiment of what their coach once used to be on the pitch. Last night was a perfect culmination of their quality as well as their attitude, as they blew away Atalanta in a 15-minute first half spell that saw a Chucky Lazano brace and a screamer from Matteo Politano.

      <h10><b>2. Toothless Atalanta</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        For all their attacking prowess, Atalanta were surprisingly and worryingly impotent in the final third. While certain key players were missing, several stars of their fantantasic 19/20 season including Gosens and Papu Gomes were a part of their starting XI. They only created one genuine chance, which Lammers tucked away and could have conceded even more if not for a couple of brilliant saves from their goalkeeper. For the first time this season, Atalanta looked like they had run out of ideas from the get go and that didn’t change through the course of the game. Maybe they had one eye on their midweek fixture in the Champions League and in retrospect this could simply end up being an anomaly, but Atalanta weren’t the relentless animal we’ve come to expect over the last 12 months.

      <h10><b>3. The Return of Josip Ilicic</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        On a brighter note for the Nerazzurri, last night marked the return of Josip Ilicic. The Slovenian’s absence from the team has been well documented and there’s not a single person in the world who cannot sympathise with Atalanta’s no.72.  The forward was one of the best players in Italy last season, or the best according to Chris Hamill of Football Daily, and admirers of the beautiful game world over can breathe a sigh of relief that he is back to doing what he does best. It truly would have been a great disappointment if he were to hang up his boots, as was previously reported as a possibility, and all we can do is hope that the events of the last few months have not affected his game in any way.

      <h10><b>4. #EndPoliceBrutalityInNigeria</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Footballers are not just athletes. They are superstars. They have a global reach and that is more true today than it has ever been before. While ex-pros scoff at the modern footballer for social media antics and prioritizing off the pitch matters such as brand deals and haircuts, they need to be commended for using their platform in a constructive way. Marcus Rashford has won hearts the world over with his work in England, and Victor Osimhen, Napoli’s record signing, promoted an important message after his goal last night. Nigeria has, in light of the pandemic, one of the epicenters of police brutality. While a lot of Osimhen’s Nigerian cohort have been doing their best to support their comrades via social media, the striker revealed a shirt adorned with a simple message: #EndPoliceBrutalityInNigeria. How much does one sentence on a player’s t-shirt mean? How much of an impact does it really have? Most importantly, do these questions matter? No, they do not. As compared to other social media movements, the atrocities in Nigeria have barely received coverage and Osimhens actions go a long way towards fixing that. With everyday, the modern day footballer is squashing the idea that they should simply ‘stick to football’ and it is high time we appreciate, not belittle them for it.

      <h10><b>5. Hold Up… Do We Actually Have A Title Race!?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Young fans of today often find it hard to believe that the Serie A was once the mecca of European football. The best players would play there and their teams often went far in European competitions. The last nine years have seen only one champion, in the form of Juventus, and the greats, most significantly the Milan clubs, have seen a drastic decline from what they were a decade ago. As super clubs dominate all but one of Europe’s top five leagues (and even that is debatable), the Serie A’s stock had never been lower. While Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival did change that to a certain extent, this season offers up something much more exciting. Juventus look pale and with a new manager at the helm, things might not be as easy as they have been before. On the other hand, Conte, Lukaku and co. look devastating and are probably the team best placed to usurp the old lady’s crown. As things stand, AC Milan are top of the table, and with the lion spearheading their attack, anything can happen. Napoli are the underdogs, Atalanta are the dark horses and finally… oh yes, finally, Italian football is exciting again.
