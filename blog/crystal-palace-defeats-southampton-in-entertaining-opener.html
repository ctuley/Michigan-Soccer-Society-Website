      <h12><b>Final Score: Crystal Palace 1 - 0 Southampton</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Crystal Palace opened its 2020/2021 Premier League campaign with a win against Southampton at Selhurst Park. A first-half goal from Wilfried Zaha and stellar performances at the back secured the three points for the Eagles. Here are five key takeaways:

            Although he only faced five shots on goal, Vicente Guaita was the hero for Palace on Saturday. The Spaniard was confident in his shot-stopping and distribution, providing a steady hand for the full 90 minutes and giving his side a chance to maintain its lead. Southampton was fairly quiet for most of the day, but Guaita was called upon multiple times to make tough saves, and he showed up when it counted. His dive to prevent Danny Ings’s threatening chance in the fifth minute of stoppage time was the icing on the cake of an incredible individual performance to open the season. Guaita will need to continue this level of play if Palace hopes to compete with the bigger clubs in the Premier League.

      <h10><b>2. Kouyaté Stellar in Defense</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Crystal Palace is primarily known for its counter-attack led by Wilfried Zaha, Jordan Ayew, and Andros Townsend. Roy Hodgson can also call upon players like Michy Batshuayi, Christian Benteke, and youngster Eberechi Eze to supplement his stars and put pressure on opposing defenses. Despite this plethora of attacking options, it was Cheikhou Kouyaté, a midfielder filling in at center-back, who stole the show and served as Palace’s best outfield player. Kouyaté was strong in one-on-one situations and maintained his position throughout the match. His dominant play allowed Palace’s forwards to push up the field for counter-attacks, which led to Zaha’s goal and other threatening chances. Hodgson may be faced with a tough decision in the coming weeks when Gary Cahill and Mamadou Sakho return from injuries. If Kouyaté can continue this type of play as a center-back, Hodgson will be forced to bench his traditional defenders in favor of the dynamic midfielder.

      <h10><b>3. Southampton Not Creative Enough</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Saints had a solid showing in the Premier League last season, finishing in 11th place with impressive play from Danny Ings, Jan Bednarek, and captain James Ward-Prowse leading the way. Southampton confirmed its faith in manager Ralph Hasenhüttl with a four-year contract extension keeping him at the club until 2024, however, the side got off to an ugly start in its opening match of the new season. Hasenhüttl’s men started each half with dominant spells of possession, but they could not find a way to break down the Palace defense. Their inability to score was partially due to strong play from the aforementioned Guaita and Kouyaté, but they also lacked creativity in the final third. The midfielders failed to provide consistent support for Ings and Ché Adams, and Southampton ultimately paid the price. Southampton needs to take points from mid-tier clubs like Crystal Palace if it hopes to replicate its form from last season. Hasenhüttl will look for stronger play from his midfielders and lethal finishing from his strikers in Southampton’s next game against Brentford in the Carabao Cup.

      <h10><b>4. VAR a Talking Point Once Again</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        VAR, or video assistant referee, has been subject to scrutiny since its implementation in the Premier League and other FIFA competitions over the last couple of seasons. Some people find the stoppage of play to confirm calls to be annoying while others complain that it doesn’t get all of the calls right in the first place. Both of these takes are fair, but the Premier League has doubled down in its support of VAR and is encouraging referees to turn to it more often to ensure the right calls are made in all matches. Head referee Jonathan Moss turned to his video assistant on three occasions on Saturday and in all three instances, the right call was made. Moss mistakenly gave a red card to Southampton’s Kyle Walker-Peters, but the defender was allowed to stay in the game after his challenge was confirmed to be less severe. Later on, the referee did not give a penalty to Southampton following a dicey challenge from Cheikhou Kouyaté, and VAR confirmed that the challenge was completely fair. Although Palace received help from the “eyes in the sky” with the Kouyaté call, the Eagles did have a goal disallowed after both Jordan Ayew and Wilfried Zaha were found to be just offside in the 82’. Overall, it was a good day for VAR as all three calls were either correctly changed or confirmed, but expect more discussion throughout the season as fans are bound to disagree with the system at some point.

      <h10><b>5. Massive Result For Palace</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Crystal Palace is a somewhat popular pick to be relegated to the Championship following this year’s Premier League. The Eagles disappointingly finished in 14th last season and failed to bring in many players to bolster the squad. Palace will need to grab as many points as it can against mid and lower-table clubs this season if it hopes to stay in the top flight of English football. Roy Hodgson and his players got off to a great start with their win over Southampton on Saturday, and the result is even bigger when you look at Palace’s upcoming league matches. Manchester United, Everton, and Chelsea are all on the schedule in the next three weeks leaving Hodgson and his side in a difficult position. If they can grab two to four points over that stretch, the Eagles may be primed for a successful season and a mid-table finish. If they suffer two or three defeats, Wilfried Zaha and company may start their search for new clubs following the conclusion of the season. Only time will tell in what promises to be a long and dramatic season in South London.
