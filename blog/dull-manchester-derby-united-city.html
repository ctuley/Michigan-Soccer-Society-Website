    <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester United 0 - 0 Manchester City</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The highly anticipated matchup of local rivals didn’t live up to the billing this time, even though both United and City are struggling this season one would expect more from this match. It was a game of few chances as the opposing managers’ gameplans seemed to cancel each other out, and the most interesting storyline came off the field with Paul Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola declaring earlier in the week his client’s intention to leave Manchester United as soon as possible. Here are five key takeaways:

            Manchester United set up in a 4-4-2 diamond formation but it was effectively a 4-2-2-2 with Fred and Scott McTominay sitting deep and Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes playing behind the strikers. Up top, the Red Devils elected to go with Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood. It was a smart and effective setup from manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær who seems to excel at setting up teams for big games as noted here by Grace Robertson on Twitter.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            United was able to frustrate City by clogging passing lanes. McTominay often dropped deeper into the backline in possession to offer another option to break up the City press and to try and stifle City’s attack. In attack, both Pogba and Fernandes were able to make incisive passes to Rashford and Greenwood but were unable to create a single big chance.
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Manchester City set up in a 4-2-3-1 with Kevin De Bruyne playing in the #10 role and a double pivot of Fernandinho and Rodri behind him. It’s been interesting to witness De Bruyne’s evolution from an attacking eight in a midfield three to a pure playmaker/attacker as part of a front four.
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            The decline of Manchester City has been attributed to a myriad of reasons including David Silva leaving, Sergio Aguero’s injury problems and other fitness issues in defense. In attack, it seems to me that the main issue is City’s overreliance on De Bruyne. It makes them one-dimensional, predictable and creates an ultimately uninteresting style of play. Teams like United can key on De Bruyne while effectively counter-attacking, which has been the story of City’s issues in matches recently.

    <h10><b>2. Ole’s Still At The Wheel</b></h10>
    <br></br>



          <h13>
            The never-ending saga of “Should Manchester United Fire Ole” sadly continues. Unless the wheels completely fall off this United team, Ole will be able to grind out results like this against top teams and then predictably struggle against teams who prefer to sit deeper. After United bowed out of the Champions League group stage this week the exhausting cycle of “should-he-stay-or-should-he-go?” has reverberated around Twitter and filtered through the reactionary punditry of TV and radio.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired it has become clear that the issues at the club lie off the pitch and in the boardroom. More specifically with the lack of leadership and vision of chief executive Ed Woodward. A former accountant, Woodward seems out of his depth when it comes to transfer dealings and is utterly unqualified to be setting the football philosophy at a club as historic as Manchester United.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            There needs to be a director of football installed immediately. Someone who has been around the game and understands how to set up a football club for both the long and short term. Woodward should no longer have direct control over the footballing operations. It’s surprising that the Glazers — who own United — accept this level of incompetence. They have spent close to a billion dollars on transfers in the years following Ferguson’s departure. They have been by far the most inefficient spenders in the Premier League. If they simply spent smarter they could save money and improve the club.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            As the figurehead of the club, Ole will always take the brunt of the criticism. But the real decision-makers at the club need to be held responsible. I don’t believe Ole is the man to take United back to the top, but you have to respect the fact that he led United to 3rd place last season and has successfully integrated academy products into the team. Woodward and Ole seem to have a decent relationship, but it’s Harry Potter-esque in that neither can live while the other survives. Sooner or later, either Woodward or Ole will be forced out.

    <h10><b>3. Greenwood Back Down To Earth</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Much was made last season about Mason Greenwood’s strike rate which was deemed “clinical” by many. But taking a look at the xG it was clear his overperformance was unsustainable. Greenwood netted 10 goals last season in the Premier League from an xG of 3.39. This season he has one goal from 1.64 xG, which isn’t to say he is underperforming. He has simply met the statistical concept of variance. Greenwood is actually doing better per 90 with his xG this season (0.30) than last (0.23) that could be down to playing more centrally. That’s a good sign that he is continuing to progress. Even if his goal tally is down this season, I suspect that his xG tally will be better and the Manchester United hierarchy should recognize this.

          United’s diamond formation has been effective at times this season allowing them to play both Bruno and Pogba at the same time with the defensive support of two additional midfielders. Both played last season in a 4-2-3-1 with Pogba in the double pivot and Fernandes in the #10 role. But it was determined that United were too exposed defensively with both in the lineup. This led some to point out that United need to pair Pogba with an elite ball-winner to get the most out of him. A comparison has been made between the pairing of Tanguy Ndombele at Spurs with Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Nemanja Matic is 32 and perhaps no longer as reliable to hoover up balls ahead of the defense and I still don’t know what Scott McTominay is good at. So Fred may be the best option to pair with Pogba but Ole has seemed reluctant to play them together. The diamond is too rigid of a formation to play consistently but unless a winter buy is made it may be the best option United have.

    <h10><b>5. Dear Managers, Use Your Subs</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Pep Guardiola have been calling for five substitutes to be allowed in Premier League games which is perfectly reasonable even if they are biased because of their club’s participation in European football. But then Pep and Ole in today’s match both used a single substitution out of the three allotted. In a match that was crying out for more energy and invention in the second half to leave the attacking talent of Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva and Donny van de Beek on the bench is criminal. Even if you don’t push for victory, rotating players is necessary for injury prevention. I support the five sub rule because of the condensed schedule and lack of preseason which has seen muscle injuries spike this season. Even in normal times, not using your substitutes is idiotic. Hopefully, the managers and the Premier League come to their senses and adopt the five subs rule and make full use of it.
