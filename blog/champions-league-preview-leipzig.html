      Under new manager Julian Nagelsmann, RB Leipzig have become one of the most exciting teams to watch in Europe this season. While a large number of draws kept Leipzig from knocking Bayern off the top of the Bundesliga, they have been extremely difficult to beat this season - losing only six games out of the 45 they’ve played in all competitions. Part of this has been their spectacular group of young players performing exceptionally well despite their young age - the average age of the squad is just under 23 - but it’s also been because of one of the best young managers in the game. After a few strong years at Hoffenheim, the 32 year old Nagelsmann - who wouldn’t even be the oldest player on a lot of the teams he has faced this season - has mixed a sharp tactical mind with an incredible ability to develop young talent to create a team that could be a force in Europe for years to come.

            Or at least, they would have if the super clubs weren’t able to swoop in and buy their players before they have a chance to grow as a team and become the dominant force they were meant to be. It’s the sad reality of modern soccer that a great young team can come along with a great season, but get picked apart before they can take the next step. It happened with the 2016-17 Monaco team, it happened with last season’s Ajax team, and now it’s happening to this RB Leipzig squad. Timo Werner is off to Chelsea, rumors constantly surround Dayot Upamecano, and don’t expect the likes of Konrad Laimer and Christopher Nkunku to stick around much longer. But if there’s one thing RB Leipzig does well, it’s reload. They know they’re likely to remain a selling club, so Leipzig are ahead of the game by bringing in a ton of young talent from around Europe and especially their Red Bull counterpart Salzburg. Whether the new crop of players will be as good as the current one remains to be seen, but don’t expect a Monaco like drop-off from them in the near future.

      For now, they will focus on the Champions League and their upcoming quarterfinal matchup with Atletico Madrid. It should be an interesting tactical battle between Nagelsmann and Simeone, but most of the attention will likely be on how Leipzig fare in the final third without the talismanic Timo Werner.

    <h10><b>How Will They Line Up:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      What’s great about Leipzig is how tactically flexible they are, especially in-game. They’re often extremely fluid, moving between three-at-the-back and four-at-the-back systems depending on the situation, and constantly keeping the opposition on their toes. They can play a possession-based game or go with a more counter-attacking style depending on the opponent - though the latter will be harder to do without the quick Timo Werner leading the line.

            Defensively, they are one of the most active pressing teams in Europe. Despite having the fourth highest average possession in the Bundesliga, they still registered the sixth highest number of pressures in the league - the three teams with higher possession shares than them finished 14th, 15th, and 16th in the pressures metric (fbref.com). They don’t press high, however, like a Bayern Munich or a Leverkusen. Instead, most of their pressures come in the middle third - 48.5% in fact - from sitting in a mid-block when out of possession. In the quarterfinal, expect Leipzig to try and overload the middle and overwhelm Atletico’s 4-4-2. Based on the personnel at their disposal, I think we’ll see them start out in some variation of a 3-4-3/3-4-1-2, but they could easily switch to a 4-4-2 or a 4-2-2-2 due to the versatility of their players. Expect Angelino to push far up the field on the left, while Nordi Mukiele will be a bit more conservative on the right. Against an Atletico team that like to sit deep and narrow, I imagine we’ll see one of Nkunku or Olmo playing in attacking midfield and providing width on the right-hand side.

    <h10><b>Player To Watch:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h12><b>Christopher Nkunku (Age: 22; Position: ML, AMC):</b><h12>
      <br></br>
    <h13>
      Let go far too soon by PSG, Christopher Nkunku has been unleashed under Julian Nagelsmann at Leipzig. This season, Nkunku has emerged as one of the most dangerous creative threats in the Bundesliga - being joint-third in the assist charts and ranking in the 98th percentile or higher for expected assists, shot creating actions, and key passes per 90. He’s also shown to be a bit of a goal threat - notching five goals and ranking in the 88th percentile for non-penalty expected goals per 90. His passing and dribbling make him seriously dangerous when in possession, but he’s also shown a lot of quality without the ball with his movement on offense and pressing on defense. Without Timo aWernerShould Leipzig make it past Atletico Madrid, Nkunku may get a chance at revenge against PSG in the semi-final. Don’t be surprised if he makes the most of that chance.

    <h10><b>Prediction: Semi-Final</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Predicting how Leipzig will do in the rest of the Champions League is hard. On one hand, they’re a team that’s extremely difficult to beat which helps in knockout competitions. On the other hand, they’ll be without Timo Werner - their best player this season - who provides most of their goal threat and a lot of their creative threat. For me, they’re boom or bust. I could easily see them making a run to the final if they can catch PSG or Atalanta off-guard in the semi-final. However, they could easily struggle to break down a resilient Atletico Madrid team and go out in the quarters. For my prediction, I’ll go in the middle. I think Nagelsmann will outsmart Simeone and figure out a way to break through Atletico’s tight defense, but PSG will just be too strong for them in the semi-final. If they come across Atalanta in the next round, that could go either way and might be the most interesting matchup of the whole competition. Whatever happens, Leipzig will be overlooked going into the final stages because of Werner’s departure, but with their young talent and masterful manager, they might shock some people by making a run.
