    <h10>Everton Get Big Derby Win At Anfield</h10>

    <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool 0 - 2 Everton</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In a hard-fought game, Everton beat Liverpool 2-0 to bring them level on points with a game in hand. Everton had not beaten Liverpool since 2010 and had not beaten them at Anfield since 1999. Richarlison opened the scoring in the 3rd minute after James Rodriguez slid a well-timed through ball behind Ozan Kabak, and substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson sealed the win with an 83rd-minute penalty after Trent Alexander-Arnold impeded Dominic Calvert-Lewin from placing a rebound opportunity into an empty net. Liverpool had the majority of possession even after captain Jordan Henderson came off injured, but failed to score against a resolute Everton defense.

    <h10><b>1. Everton’s Shapeshifting Backline</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Everton lined up with three players who typically play center back, Michael Keane, Ben Godfrey, and Mason Holgate, plus two fullbacks, Seamus Coleman and Lucas Digne. However, because the speed of Godfrey and Holgate allows both to comfortably defend in wide areas, Everton could shift between a back four and a back five to balance out surging runs of the two fullbacks without leaving themselves uncovered. Everton’s defense stayed focused and battled for all 90 minutes, and the attacking presence of Digne and Coleman provided valuable respite from Liverpool possession. Their efforts almost led to a goal as well, but Coleman’s diving header from a curling Digne cross was palmed away smartly by Alisson.

    <h10><b>2. Jordan Pickford Back On Track?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      As England’s typical first-choice goalkeeper, Everton goalie Jordan Pickford faces constant scrutiny and has responded this season with many critical errors. In the past month, Pickford was also left on the bench multiple times in favor of Swedish international, Robin Olsen. However, Pickford was excellent against Liverpool and earned the man of the match award. He was called into action early on, diving to his left to save a dipping Henderson volley, and tipped a powerful Alexander-Arnold shot over the crossbar. Throughout the game, Pickford was assured when required to claim balls in the air, an area where he can at times show weakness, and also demonstrated his signature distribution with multiple accurate long balls. In the second half, Pickford used excellent timing to stuff Salah at close range,  Liverpool’s best chance of the game. Perhaps this performance will boost Pickford’s confidence, and in turn, his chances at remaining England’s number one.

    <h10><b>3. Phillips Solid As Substitute</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In contrast to fellow centerback Ozan Kabak, who continually looked lost and was beaten for Everton’s first goal, Nat Phillips delivered a solid performance after coming on for Jordan Henderson. Unlike Henderson, who typically plays midfield, Phillips offered a better aerial presence in Liverpool’s half and came close to testing Pickford on a back-post header following a first-half free kick, but his shot hit the side netting. Additionally, Phillips distributed well from a central role and showed a decent connection with Alexander-Arnold on Liverpool’s right side. When Liverpool began to dominate the game early in the second half, Phillips also provided good cover to block attempted Everton counterattacks, highlighted by foiling Richarlison after he appeared to have an open route towards goal in the 61st minute. Despite the loss, Liverpool may have found a better partner for Jordan Henderson, or whoever replaces him at starting center back for the rest of the season.

    <h10><b>4. Liverpool Handle Everton Press</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In recent games, Liverpool, and particularly their goalkeeper Alisson, have given away sloppy goals as a result of turnovers in their own defensive third. Although Everton defended deeply for most of the game, they did make a concerted effort to attack the Liverpool defense through pressuring runs from Richarlison and Abdoulaye Doucoure. However, Alisson organized his defenders well, and he looked much more assured on the ball. Although he did not contribute many long balls forward, Alisson’s passing linked well with Thiago and Wijnaldum and provided Liverpool with an attacking platform.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Richarlison Improving In Center Forward Role</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Due to an injury to top goalscorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison started for the third consecutive game as a central striker. Against Fulham last week, Richarlison posed little attacking threat, and against Manchester City on Wednesday, he exhibited effort but did not offer a consistent presence in the offensive third. However, Richarlison looked much more comfortable against Liverpool, and his direct runs without the ball threatened Liverpool’s inexperienced defenders constantly. Although he had limited opportunities due to Liverpool’s high possession numbers, he was clinical. In addition to finishing Everton’s first goal, Richarlison set up their second after he followed a clever turn with a driving run and threaded pass to Calvert-Lewin before he was fouled. While this season has been largely disappointing for Richarlison despite his team’s overall success, this performance may reignite his attacking form in the final weeks as Everton fight for a spot in European football. When asked about him following the game, Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti responded by saying “he’s back,” a dangerous sign for the rest of the league.
