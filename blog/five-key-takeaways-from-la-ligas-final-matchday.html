      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After a season that lasted almost a full year, La Liga is finally over, with Real Madrid crowned as champions. Here are my takeaways from the last matchday of the season:
      </h13>

  <!-- 1st Row -------------------------------------------------->

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>1. The Pichichi And The Zamora</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Lionel Messi claimed his seventh Pichichi Trophy today, given to the highest goalscorer in La Liga. He ended the season with 25 goals, 4 ahead of second place Karim Benzema. Messi scored twice in Barcelona’s 5-0 win over Alaves, who finished the season in 16th place.
The Zamora trophy, given to the goalkeeper with the least amount of goals conceded, was won by Thibaut Courtois, who only let in 20 goals this season. This is his third Zamora (2013,2014), and his first with Real Madrid. Courtois did not play in his team’s draw with Leganes on Sunday night.

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>2. Bruno And Santi Get A Proper Send-Off</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Bruno Soriano and Santi Cazorla played their last matches for Villarreal on Sunday night, where they thrashed Eibar 4-0 (Cazorla had an assist). Both Bruno and Cazorla began their careers in Villarreal’s academy, where they blossomed into great players. Bruno has spent his entire career with the Yellow Submarine, and he has made 324 appearances for the club. Cazorla has had 3 separate stints with Villarreal, as well as Malaga and Arsenal, and he has racked up 83 goals in his club career. Now, as they are 36 and 35 respectively, they have both opted to leave their boyhood club for good. Bruno has announced that he will retire from playing, and Cazorla will leave on a free transfer, most likely to Xavi’s Al Sadd.

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>3. Sevilla Beat Valencia To Deny Them European Football</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Sevilla beat Valencia 1-0, courtesy of a wonder-goal from left back Sergio Reguilon. This means that Valencia will finish in 9th place, which is very poor for a team of their stature. Last season they qualified for the Champions League, and even made it out of the group stage (eventually losing to Atalanta). They will be very disappointed with their season, and will look to return to their former glory next season. They may also want to sign a striker, their top scorer, Maxi Gomez, finished the season with 10 goals.
      </h13>

  <!-- 4th Row -------------------------------------------------->
  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. Leganes Draw With Real Madrid Not Enough To Save Them From Relegation</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        From the beginning of this match, it looked like everyone wanted Leganes to win, even the Madrid players. Real Madrid had already won the title, and Leganes were 3 points from getting relegated. The Madrid players gave little effort, and Leganes capitalized and outplayed them. They were unlucky not to grab a winner, and sadly, they will be relegated. It’s tough to see a team like Leganes go down, a team that underperformed this season despite having a quality squad. Hopefully they can rebound and achieve promotion from La Liga Smartbank next season, but they will need to be smart in this summer’s transfer market.

  <!-- 5th Row -------------------------------------------------->
  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>5. Wild game between Levante and Getafe</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Getafe needed to win this match to secure a Europa League spot, and they came up short against a tough Levante side. You can’t fault Getafe for their lack of chances, however; there were three goals that were overturned by VAR in this match for various offenses (1 for Levante, and 2 for Getafe), and Getafe’s Jaime Mata hit the post from a penalty in the 71st minute. Eventually, Levante right back Coke grabbed a winner in the 99th minute to ensure that Getafe would finish the season in 8th place. Getafe do still have a shot at a Champions League spot, but they have to beat an in-form Inter Milan and win the current Europa League, a tough ask considering the other teams still in the competition.

      <h10><b>Bonus Takeaway!</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Congratulations to Granada, who will play in the Europa league next season for the first time in the club’s history, due to a 4-0 win over Athletic Club on Sunday night. This feat becomes all the more impressive when you find out that they were promoted from La Liga Smartbank last year. I wish them all the luck in the world in next year’s Europa League campaign.
