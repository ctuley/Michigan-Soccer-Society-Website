    <h10>Liverpool Struggle to Unlock Everton’s Defense in Scoreless Merseyside Derby</h10>

    <h12><b>Final Score: Everton 0 - 0 Liverpool</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Goodison Park was home to the second Merseyside Derby of the season as Liverpool and Everton came head to head in their first games back from the three-month halt in play. Contrary to their meeting at Anfield that saw seven goals scored, this match was rather uneventful as each team ended the game with only a few decent chances. Here are five key takeaways from the game:

    <h10><b>1. Liverpool’s Inevitable Title Will Have to Wait a Bit Longer</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Needing only two wins to clinch their first Premier League title, Liverpool’s impending triumph will be prolonged following their draw today. Their 23 point cushion at the top of the league is one that will surely carry them to a winning season, however, their form as of late raises questions about how dominant they will be going forward. Liverpool have won just two of their last seven matches in all competitions and it seems as though their dominance that was displayed through most of the season may be diminishing. With tests from the likes of second-place Manchester City and a strong Chelsea side in the near future, Liverpool will have to prove their resilience and show that they are still one of the top teams in the world.

            After Napoli sacked manager Carlo Ancelotti in early December, it was only a matter of time before a new club swooped in with a fresh contract. Less than two weeks later, he found himself signing to a four year deal with Everton and promised to do everything he could to make the club’s vision a reality. After a rocky start to the season, Ancelotti has transformed this Everton side into a disciplined and dangerous machine, one who could be poised to make some noise next season. Since his appointment, Everton have lost only three games, all away from home to sides in the top half of the table. Their draw with Liverpool makes Everton the only Premier League team who remain unbeaten at home across all competitions in 2020. With a tight backline and strong midfield and attacking performances, it seems as though their time off has allowed for Ancelotti to implement some effective new tactics into play for Everton, and they held strong against Liverpool’s dangerous advances. Things are looking bright for the Merseyside club, and everyone’s eyes will be on them over Ancelotti’s next few years.

    <h10><b>3. Liverpool’s Fitness Issues Expose Weaknesses in Their Squad</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With back-to-back golden boot winner Mo Salah on the bench and world-class Andy Robertson out of the lineup completely, manager Jurgen Klopp was forced to tweak his starting lineup. Takumi Minamino got a rare start on the right-wing and James Milner found himself at left-back rather than his normal midfield position. While Minamino settled into his position as the game progressed, the impact from the lack of Robertson was felt from the first blow of the whistle. Play down the left side was stagnant at points as Milner often found himself pulling the ball back to his favored right foot rather than continuing with his left as Robertson famously does. Injuries to Milner and center back Joel Matip only amplified Liverpool’s problems with center back Joe Gomez forced to play out on the left and third-string Dejan Lovren called into action alongside Van Dijk. While Gomez put on a decent performance, his lack of a solid left foot resulted in the same problems as with Milner and halted play down the left side. Lovren exemplified his inability to keep up with the pace of the game as he was beaten easily by Everton’s attackers multiple times. While Liverpool may not need any big signings this summer, it may be a good idea to invest in some stronger defensive substitutes, especially a solid left-back.

    <h10><b>4. Richarlison Fails to Score After Bold Comments on Van Dijk</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In the recent days leading up to the derby match, Everton’s top striker Richarlison had some rather audacious words to be said about Virgil Van Dijk. In an interview with Desimpedidos, the Brazilian forward stated, “Yes, he is a great defender, but I've already dribbled past him… He was chosen as one of the top three in the world as he had an excellent season, but yes, for me, there are better defenders." These criticisms set off ripples of anger in some of the football community, as many fans consider Van Dijk as a top one or two defender right now. The Dutchman has certainly made a case for his praise, being the current PFA Player of the Year and placing second in the Ballon d’Or behind the great Leo Messi. The match provided the perfect opportunity for Richarlison to back up his words, but when push came to shove he was unable to slot one in the back of the net.

    <h10><b>5. Football Without Fans is Different and Players Will Have to Continue Adjusting</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      As the first week of the Premier League comes to a close, it is clear that there is a different atmosphere in the stadiums, and players will have to continue to adjust over the next few weeks. Playing in front of empty stadiums is rather unprecedented, and the lack of crowd involvement is very visible in the progression of the games. Momentum is a rather abstract concept at the time as talent exposes itself as the driving force behind most games. Energy levels seem to be depleting faster than ever, something that can be expected after months without training, but the lack of fans makes it even harder for players to keep motivating themselves to give it all they’ve got. As the weeks go on, players will surely adapt to the new style of play and teams will become more and more polished as a whole. After months of waiting for football is back, and while it may be different, it’s a much-welcomed step towards normalcy for all those involved.
