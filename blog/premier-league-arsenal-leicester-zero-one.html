      <h12><b>Final Score: Arsenal 0 - 1 Leicester City</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        When Leicester City famously overcame the odds and won the 2015/16 Premier League title, people often forget that they only lost three out of their 38 Premier League games. Two of those three losses came, however, against the Gunner, their opponents last night. It had been 47 years since the Foxes downed Arsenal at their home and although it was a relatively uneventful game, it is one that will go down in the history books.

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It wasn’t a vintage performance from Leicester City, but they got the job done… somehow. In typical Brendan Rogers fashion, the team was defensively very solid. It is hard to blame Rodgers for adopting more defensive approaches due to lack of key personnel. Indeed, the Foxes started the game without Jamie Vardy, Ricardo Pereria, and Wilfred Ndidi, whose absence in particular completely changes the team’s defensive prowess. With no Vardy, Iheanacho, Perez or Slimani, Leicester started the game without an actual no.9, with Harvey Barnes occupying the spot instead. Leicester had clearly set up to hit Arsenal on the counter attack, and were actually relatively successful in absorbing pressure and then attempting to race towards Leno’s goalpost. Every counter attack they could muster ended in one way only, without any end product. Their first shot of the game came in the 79th minute, evidence for the lack of efficiency, conviction and a genuine goalscorer. Enter Jamie Vardy...

      <h10><b>2. The Man, The Myth, The Legend</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I covered Leicester vs Arsenal in the Carabao Cup a few weeks ago and admitted that I shudder to see what happens to this Leciester side without their talisman. Jamie Vardy’s impact on the game last night only heightened those fears. It wasn’t just his goal, but his overall influence on how the team played. Leicester were direct all game, but they finally had someone who could profit off their long through balls. An out and out striker on the pitch provides players like Barnes and Maddison with encouragement and Leicester looked toothless prior to the arrival of Vardy. The goal itself was a historic moment. Along with being the first winning goal scored for Leicester at Arsenal’s home in 47 years, Jamie Vardy, with his 11th goal in 12 games against the Gunners, became the highest scorer of any visiting player at the Emirates, overtaking Harry Kane on four goals. The goal came after a lovely passing move, but Leicester only had two shots on target, both coming from their number nine. It seems like Leicester are looking at a post-Vardy era as a ‘we’ll cross the bridge when we reach it’ situation. Is that sensible? Not at all. Does anyone care right now? I highly doubt it. Vardy has undoubtedly earned legend status already, and proof of that came in the form of a helpless Ian Wright, who let the Arsenal fan in him take over as he bluntly put after the game, “He always scores, he’s like Drogba, except he’s even worse.” High praise indeed.

      <h10><b>3. A New Look Arsenal, Or Was It?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        A lot of the talk surrounding the signing of Ghanaian Thomas Partey was that his arrival will allow Arteta to move to a 4-3-3, the formation he and Pep worked with at City and what seems to be his preferred, long term system for Arsenal. While the no. 18 definitely had a shaky game, which we could owe to rustiness and still being in an adaptive phase, he was, for the most part, not playing in a three man midfield. While it did say 4-3-3 on the official lineup, that was far from the truth. For the majority of the game, Arsenal looked like they were playing with three centre backs. Yes, several teams use this shape when they are in possession, as the CDM drops in between the two centre backs. However, Arsenal maintained this shape with and without the ball. For a period in the first half, Tierney tucked in and Saka moved to left wing back. For the better part of the second half, Xhaka played in a deeper role, which got pushed back a further 5 yards when David Luiz was replaced by Shkodran Mustafi. While it is hard to imagine Arteta not eventually moving to a 4-3-3, questions have to be asked if Arsenal have the personnel for the system, and more importantly, how is Arteta likely to handle the situation? All we know is that if he does so by setting the team up like he did last night, Arsenal may find their season going downhill before they can even say the words 'Arteta Out'.

      <h10><b>4. Realistic Goals For The Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Arsenal fans have had a reality check since the season has begun. Leicester fans had their reality check right after Project Restart. Both clubs have promise, but are a long way away from where they want to be, especially in the case of Arsenal. Victories over Liverpool, the FA Cup and the tying down of Aubameyang to a new contract were all celebrated by the Gunners’ fanbase and while Arteta is showing subtle hints that he might be the real deal, the only way Arsenal can have a good season is if they temper their expectations. With several players settling in and a side still heavily dependent on their captain for goals, (evidenced by their rough patch coinciding with the Gabonese international’s mini goal drought) Top 4 might be too far for the men from North London, especially considering how their rivals have strengthened. Both Leicester and Arsenal should have similar expectations from the season. Firstly, both teams should be able to settle into a fixed system, one that doesn’t involve three centre backs, but the 4-3-3 that both managers seem to want to play. Secondly, they must aim towards going deep into the Europa league and securing European football for next season. Finally, both teams must also develop a style of play that does not depend solely on one man for the goals. Aubameyang and Vardy are two of the deadliest strikers in the Premier League and as much as we might hate to admit, their days at the top are numbered. The sooner both clubs recognise this, the better.

      <h10><b>5. Finally, A Normal Week Of Premier League Footy</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While there are two games left this gameweek, including Burnley vs Spurs (When Jose is involved there’s always room for drama), we have had our first week of some relatively ordinary and sane results. No massive upstes, no dramatic comebacks and no humblings. It isn’t as exciting, but if we’re being honest, it's a welcome change. With all the things happening this year, any semblance of normality should be wholeheartedly accepted. It is, however, also a reflection of the past few weeks. With even the biggest teams shipping tons of goals, it does seem like teams are practicing caution and simply taking a step back rather than throwing themselves right into the mix of things. It is a long season and there will be plenty of time from drama, but last night’s game was on the other end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, trying to predict this season has proved an impossible task and long may it continue.
