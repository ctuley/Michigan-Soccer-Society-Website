    <h12><b>Final Score: Bayern Münich 4 - 2 Bayer 04 Leverkusen</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Bayern Munich confirmed their dominance of Germany by completing the domestic double in the DFB Pokal Final over a sloppy Bayer Leverkusen. Here are the five key takeaways.

    <br></br>
    <div class="row-articles">

          <h13>
            From the start, Munich were dangerous in attack. Kingsley Coman, Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry led the line for the Bavarians with Thomas Müller sitting behind Lewandowski in the second striker role.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            A link-up between Müller, Joshua Kimmich and Lewandowski resulted in a free-kick from 19 yards out after Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba put a shoulder to Lewandowski’s back. David Alaba took a short run-up and just lifted the ball over the wall of players and into the back of the net for the opening goal in the 16th minute.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Hansi Flick has imposed his higher intensity style on Bayern after becoming manager. His influence was seen in the second goal — Kimmich intercepted a Leverkusen pass before sliding Gnabry in on goal from the right-wing. Gnabry made no mistake with a clinical finish into the bottom left corner. It was a lightning-quick move after winning the ball back and illustrated how many different ways Bayern can hurt opponents.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            In the 59th minute, Manuel Neuer booted the ball upfield to Lewandowski who brought the ball down with a deft first touch before volleying the ball with his next touch which may have caught Leverkusen’s goalkeeper Lukás Hrádecky off guard. Hrádecky attempted to parry the ball away but the ball swerved down and deflected into his net off his hands.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            Lewandowski completed his brace in the 89th minute, Ivan Perisic was played in by Kimmich before he cut the ball back to Lewandowski who finished with an outrageous chip over the helpless Hrádecky to make it 4-1. Lewandowski continues to make an argument for best striker in the world with 51 goals in all competitions this season.

    <h10><b>2. Munich Struggle on Set Pieces</b></h10>
    <br></br>



          <h13>
            Both of Leverkusen’s goals came from set-pieces. Sven Bender practically jumped over Alaba heading the ball past Neuer to make it 3-1 in the 63rd minute. Alaba has played well since moving from left-back to center back but his size remains an issue. Alphonso Davies’ hand deflected the ball on a corner giving a penalty to Leverkusen in the dying moments, which Kai Havertz calmly dispatched for a final consolation goal.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            This was the only obvious negative in the game for Bayern but it could be an Achilles heel in the Champions League. Bayern are one of the favorites when the competition resumes in August but they likely won’t have the margin of error that they enjoyed here. Flick may look to a taller center half instead of Alaba to shore up his defense in August.
          </h13>

    <h10><b>3. Diaby Shines for Leverkusen</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Moussa Diaby was the most dangerous player on the pitch for Leverkusen. In an otherwise lackluster performance by the team, Diaby was a creative force. He asked questions of the Bayern defense on the break, firing in several crosses that should have been converted for goals by Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In the second half, Diaby exploded past Davies and crossed it to a wide-open Volland who whiffed on the chance. Moments later Lewandowski scored to widen the gap in a sequence that was emblematic of Leverkusen’s performance. The scoreline could have been completely different had Leverkusen taken their chances.

          In the 87th minute with a 3-1 lead Hansi Flick brought on Phillippe Coutinho and Ivan Perisic off the bench. It was a major flex by the Bavarian giants and a reminder of how much depth they possess. Both Coutinho and Perisic are on loan, they were both recently two of the top attackers in the world and they can’t even break into Bayern’s starting lineup.
        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          Leroy Sané’s signing became official earlier this week adding to an already loaded winger group. There is some serious pace to burn with Gnabry, Coman, Sané, and Davies available to play on the wing.
        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          In the midfield former right-back Kimmich is thriving in a holding role alongside Goretzka, Corentin Tolisso, Thiago, and Javi Martinez all are available as well. At the forward position Joshua Zirkzee seems to be being groomed as the heir to Lewandowski’s throne with four goals and one assists in just nine Bundesliga appearances this season.
        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          In conclusion, Bayern’s reserves could probably win the Bundesliga.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Goodbye Kai Havertz?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The rumors have been swirling that Kai Havertz could be the latest of Chelsea’s blockbuster signings this summer. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he could be available for around $80 million down his previous valuations of $100 million. Christian Falk reported that Havertz wants a meeting to discuss his future with the club, he also said Bayern will not bid this summer and Real Madrid are “hesitating.”
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      If this was Havertz’s final game at Leverkusen, it was an incredible run and a meteoric rise. At just 21-years-old he had 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions this season. He was part of an exciting and attacking Leverkusen side that regularly challenged heavyweights like Bayern and Dortmund.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      If he ends up at Chelsea he will join a crowded group of young attackers all hungry for playing time. It’s easy to underestimate the slight Havertz, but you shouldn’t. He nearly carried Leverkusen to the Champions League again this season and his ability to play in multiple positions along with his eye for goal will translate into success wherever he goes.
    </h13>
