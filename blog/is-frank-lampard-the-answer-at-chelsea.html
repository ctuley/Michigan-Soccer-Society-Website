      <h13>
        Due to his standing as a player at Chelsea - a legendary midfielder who led the team to multiple league titles and a Champions League victory in 2012 - Frank Lampard’s job status probably isn’t in question and likely won’t be any time soon. However, as of writing Chelsea currently sit eighth in the Premier League table, level on points with Aston Villa despite playing two more games. While Chelsea fans may be willing to give him more time based on their affection for Lampard the player, based on their current standing and recent results I think the conversation of whether or not Lampard the manager is the right answer long term for Chelsea is one worth having. Let’s investigate:
      </h13>

      <h10><b>Player Recruitment:</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        This one is a little tough to judge Lampard on given how early it is in his reign and the fact that he had to deal with a transfer ban in his first season in charge. So, for this, I am going to look at the eight new players brought in during his time in charge and the players from the academy/loan army that he has integrated into the team.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite being in charge for just a season and a half, make no mistake this is very much Frank Lampard’s team. As it stands, when everyone is healthy Lampard’s preferred starting XI seems to include 9/11 players brought in during his time in charge (Kovacic and Kante the only non-Lampard players). Some Sarri and Conte signings remain as squad players, but Lampard seems to prefer using players brought in under him when available.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In 2019/20, the new pieces integrated well. Tammy Abraham finished the season as the club’s top scorer and finished 3rd in the league in non-penalty expected goals per 90 and 6th in non-penalty goals per 90. Mason Mount became a key piece of Frank Lampard’s midfield, providing very good work defensively, a deep shooting threat, and plenty of creativity from open play and set pieces. Christian Pulisic, despite injury troubles early, lit up the league post-restart with his dribbling and goal threat and was arguably Chelsea’s best player in that period. And Kurt Zouma and Reece James have become key players in 2020/21.
      </h13>

      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Often times you can overcome lesser talent by playing with a cohesive unit that knows each other very well (just look at Sheffield United last season or Burnley since their return to the Premier League), and that seemed to be what Chelsea were looking to do at first under Lampard. And even then, Chelsea were not too far off talent-wise. A new goalkeeper and leftback were needed, but other than that Chelsea were not really in need of short-term options other than depth behind the wide attacking midfielders.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        But, instead of allowing the young team to grow and gel together, Chelsea instead went and spent €250 million plus wages on eight new players (seven of whom are with the team this season). The signings of Chilwell and Mendy made sense (although the fees were probably a bit too high given their abilities), and Hakim Ziyech was a solid addition on the right side that both provided depth and an upgrade in that position - as well as instantly providing the team with a go-to creative threat. Thiago Silva has also proven himself to be a key piece despite his age.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The problem lies in the two highest-profile (and highest fee) signings from last summer - Timo Werner and Kai Havertz for a combined €133 million. Despite having excellent seasons in the Bundesliga in 2019/20, the pair have failed to integrate into their new surroundings thus far. With all the craziness of this year, including the lack of a real preseason, perhaps their failure to gel could be explained by not having enough time. However, the ease with which their fellow new signings seemed to have integrated might suggest that it is something specific to Werner and Havertz - likely what Lampard is doing with them tactically.

      <h10><b>Tactics:</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Frank Lampard tweaked formations and tactics a lot last season, but he eventually settled on a few key principles that he carried into this season. He sets his team up in a 4-3-3, with one midfielder (usually Mason Mount) pushing up to play as a link-man/deeper creator. Chelsea often press high, with Mount again pushing up to provide pressure. In possession, Chelsea push both fullbacks high to maintain width as the wide attackers (usually Pulisic and Ziyech/Hudson-Odoi) pinch in and attack the half-spaces. Without Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi, Chelsea are much more likely (and are more dangerous) to play on the counterattack when they can use the driving runs of Pulisic and Mount to cause chaos in space. Generally speaking, Lampard’s set-up works - both in the sense that it has gotten solid results so far and that it fits the makeup of the roster. Lampard’s tactical inadequacies instead come in his team selection, especially with regards to Werner and Havertz.
      </h13>
      <br></br>

      <img src="../blog-img/is-frank-lampard-the-answer-at-chelsea/is-frank-lampard-the-answer-at-chelsea-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width:80%">
      <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
      <br></br>

      <h13>
        These personnel selection problems are not new to this season. There were numerous occasions last season when Lampard would do something like play Mason Mount wide-left when Christian Pulisic was available, even though this suited neither Mount nor Pulisic. He would also field Tammy Abraham in situations where it would have been better to pick Olivier Giroud - in games where the striker would need to be more involved in buildup play or there were no creative passers fielded alongside him.
      </h13>
      <br></br>

      <h13>
        The trend has continued in 2020/21 as Timo Werner and Kai Havertz have constantly found themselves fielded in roles that do not suit them. Werner has either been fielded alone up front, finding himself isolated from service and unable to get involved enough in buildup, or wide-left where the same thing occurs but he is even more ineffective because his creative passing deficiencies and lack of ball progression are even more of an issue when playing in that role. Havertz has seen himself fielded in a variety of roles as well, none of which suit him best. He has been fielded wide-right, where his movement and shooting abilities have been wasted, or he has been fielded in a deeper midfield position, which again limits his shooting and a role in which he lacks the requisite defensive work rate.
      </h13>

      <br></br>

      <h13>
        If you were going to play Werner and Havertz in their best roles, it would unfortunately come at the expense of other players in the squad who might work better in Lampard’s preferred system. Werner, for example, was at his best in Leipzig when working in a front two with another, more physical striker. Chelsea actually has the personnel to potentially make this work by playing Werner up front with Olivier Giroud, however by doing this Lampard would be forced to drop the wingers (Pulisic, Ziyech, and Hudson-Odoi). While this may get the best out of Werner, I do not think this is what would be best for the team. Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi have been Chelsea’s best creative passers this season, and without them Werner and Giroud may not get the requisite service. On top of that, Pulisic has been one of Chelsea’s best players since the COVID restart when healthy, with his dribbling abilities creating chaos for opposition defenses.
      </h13>
      <br></br>

      <h13>
        Havertz would be easier to fit into the team, as he would just need to be played as the #10 in the 4-2-3-1 Lampard used many times last season, but it would have some detrimental effects on the way the rest of the team plays. Havertz does not put in as much work defensively as Mason Mount (the player he would replace in the lineup), and this could cause some issues further back. Similar to what we saw with Manchester United last season when Pogba came back and replaced Fred in the lineup, the decrease in defensive work done by the midfield would force Chelsea’s defenders into way more 1-on-1 situations, and would cause a lot more individual mistakes allowing for better chances for the opposition.
      </h13>
      <br></br>

      <h13>
        Both of these players have failed to integrate like their colleagues because they have not been put in a position to succeed by their manager. You can blame Lampard’s tactics for not giving Werner and Havertz roles to show what they can do at their best, but I think the blame would be better placed on Lampard’s squad-building. He had found a system that was working for the players he had, but he decided to spend big money on players that did not fit that system at all. Either he was going to have to switch the system to the detriment of the rest of the squad or try to plug square pegs into round holes. Ultimately, the failure of Werner and Havertz to integrate into this Chelsea team has been because they weren’t the right signings in the first place.

      <h10><b>Performances:</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Problems in squad-building and tactics can be glossed over if the results and performances are still there. If we look at the form chart below, which charts Chelsea’s form based on expected goal difference (10 game rolling average) dating back to Antonio Conte’s 2nd season, we can see that Lampard has returned Chelsea to roughly about the same level they were playing at when they were at their best under Sarri. He hasn’t reached the heights of Conte (even in the 2nd season), but the concerning thing is the lack of upward trend.
      </h13>
      <br></br>

      <img src="../blog-img/is-frank-lampard-the-answer-at-chelsea/is-frank-lampard-the-answer-at-chelsea-4.png" class="img-responsive" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width:80%">
      <br></br>

      <h13>
        Chelsea is still a team in transition - getting closer to title contenders on a talent level, but still missing a piece or two. But as of right now, Lampard doesn’t seem to have Chelsea moving upwards, he seems to have stabilized them. Even with the amount of talent brought in this summer, Chelsea have only returned to roughly the same peak they have hit on multiple occasions in year one. This would suggest a team without direction, and that Chelsea may have hit their ceiling under Lampard.

      <h10><b>Conclusion:</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Lampard may be a good option for Chelsea’s short-term transition period - someone who has provided stability and will provide a good framework for whoever comes next - but based on his squad-building/team selection issues and the fact that into year two (despite the significant talent jump) he doesn’t have Chelsea on an upward trajectory, I think it may be time for Chelsea to start considering longer-term options who can get more out of what they have (maybe making a play for Julian Nagelsmann or bringing in the newly available Thomas Tuchel).
