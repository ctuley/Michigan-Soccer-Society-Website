    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 2-0 RCD Mallorca</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After Mallorca won the fixture at the San Moix earlier this season, Real Madrid toppled the relegation-battling team to remain top of La Liga.

    <h10><b>1. Zidane Uses Experimental Squad: Good Results</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Zidane used another new lineup today, his 179th different starting 11 in his tenure as Madrid Manager. With Casemiro out due to an accumulation of yellow cards, and Kroos needing a rest, Zidane deployed Fede Valverde and Luka Modric at the base of a 4-2-3-1. This holding midfield system worked fine, as Modric looked like his old self, making tackles, picking out passes, and aggressively dribbling the ball upfield. Fede, on the other hand, looked out of place in this role. He is more suited as a box-to-box creator, playing upfield as opposed to sitting in front of the back four. He struggled a bit, but it wasn’t a poor performance from the Uruguayan.
      The front four is where Zidane really got creative. He started Benzema in his usual striker role, flanked by Vinicius Jr. and the out-of-form Gareth Bale. Behind them was Eden Hazard, who played as a 10, a role we have not seen him play while at Madrid. This formation seemed to work well, as Hazard and Benzema both had their fair share of the ball (I would’ve liked to see more from Hazard though), and Bale and Vinicius working the wings. Bale started well, having one shot saved in the opening minutes that mirrored his shot from the Champions League Final against Liverpool that Loris Karius fumbled into the net. Apart from that, the Welshman did very little in the match, aside from tracking back well to defend. On the opposite side...

          <h13>
            In his last 7 matches, Vinicius Jr. has had 5 goal contributions (3 goals, 2 assists) and drew the penalty against Real Sociedad. It is fair to say that the young Brazilian is finally beginning to hit his stride. In Wednesday’s match, Vinicius opened the scoring in the 19th minute with a lovely chip over Mallorca keeper Manolo Reina. A few minutes later he attempted another chip shot and hit the bar. Throughout the rest of the match, he made many off the ball runs to create space for others, and used his incredible dribbling skills to confuse Mallorca’s defenders. Another severely underrated portion of the Brazilian’s game was on show tonight: his defensive capabilities. Vinicius consistently helped Ferland Mendy lock down the left flank, and contributed heavily to Los Blancos’ clean sheet.

    <h10><b>3. Takefusa Kubo a Talent for the Future</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      A year ago Kubo would not have been able to play in this tie, due to Real Madrid’s history with putting “fear clauses” into the contacts of players that they loan, preventing them from playing against their parent club. Madrid chose not to do that with Kubo, and it tested them on Wednesday night. The Japanese international troubled Madrid’s defenders throughout the match, and was certainly Mallorca’s most dangerous player. His ability to control the ball and move quickly, weaving his way through players is amazing, and it’s no wonder that he was fouled 5 times in the match. It will be interesting to see if Mallorca attempts to keep Kubo on loan for another year (they will have to negotiate another loan for him), or if he will join Real Madrid at the end of the season.

    <h10><b>4. Mallorca Have Serious Challenge to Avoid Relegation</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Mallorca now sit in 18th place in La Liga, 3 points from safety (though they have played one more match than 17th placed Eibar). They have quite a difficult set of matches left, having to travel to Athletic Club, Atletico Madrid, and Sevilla among others. They will need star striker Ante Budimir to be in top form for the rest of the season, as they do not have much else in terms of goal threat (Budimir has almost a third of Mallorca’s goals with 9).

    <h10><b>5. Brahim Diaz: More Squad Time, or is a Loan Needed?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      For the first time since La Liga restarted, Zidane played Brahim Diaz. Brahim, who joined Madrid in the winter of 2019 from Manchester City, has shown much promise in the little time that he has been given on the pitch. He can play on both wings, and as a center forward, and is very capable with both feet. He came on for Vinicius in the 83rd minute of Wednesday’s match and made an instant impact. He very nearly scored from just outside the box, but his effort was saved by an outstretched Manolo Reina. It doesn’t take an expert to realize that Madrid have a serious talent on their hands, and it will be up to them if they choose to cultivate it, or send Brahim on loan to get more first-team experience with another club.
