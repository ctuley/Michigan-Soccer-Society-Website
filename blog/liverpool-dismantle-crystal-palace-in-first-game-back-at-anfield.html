    <h10>Liverpool Dismantle Crystal Palace in First Game Back at Anfield</h10>

    <h12><b>Final Score: Liverpool 4 - 0 Crystal Palace</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Following a slow-paced draw against Everton over the weekend, Liverpool brought the intensity to Anfield for their matchup against Crystal Palace. In a 90 minute battering, Liverpool netted four goals while Palace was left unable to even put a shot on target as they were overwhelmed by the Reds’ pressure. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

    <h10><b>1. Liverpool are an Unstoppable Force at Home</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Needing only two wins to clinch their first Premier League title, Liverpool’s impending triumph will be prolonged following their draw today. Their 23 point cushion at the top of the league is one that will surely carry them to a winning season, however, their form as of late raises questions about how dominant they will be going forward. Liverpool have won just two of their last seven matches in all competitions and it seems as though their dominance that was displayed through most of the season may be diminishing. With tests from the likes of second-place Manchester City and a strong Chelsea side in the near future, Liverpool will have to prove their resilience and show that they are still one of the top teams in the world.

    <h10><b>2. Crystal Palace Appear Sloppy on Defense</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      No goalkeeper in the world could have saved Crystal Palace today as Liverpool repeatedly shelled them with attacks. The solid defensive and midfield lines that Roy Hodgson’s men started out in were swiftly split wide open by Liverpool’s pacey wing-backs. Jordan Ayew’s unnecessary foul on Van Dijk led to Liverpool’s first goal and key passes from Mo Salah and Fabinho exposed large holes in Palace’s defensive strategy. Allowing more than 20 shots, Palace’s central duo of Mamadou Sakho and Gary Cahill found themselves overwhelmed and committed many errors throughout the match. In fact, Cahill was lucky on back to back occasions as referee Martin Atkinson missed both a questionable foul and a relatively clear handball that would have both resulted in penalty kicks for the Reds. Coming into the match on a four-game win streak, expectations were a lot higher for this team, and this match shows just why they remain a mid-table club.

            Two years after his remarkable return to the Premier League, Mohammed Salah continues to show why he deserves the title of the Egyptian King. Picking up a goal and an assist against Palace, Salah was exactly what the Reds were missing in their draw against Everton on Sunday. The shifty winger seems to always find himself getting in behind enemy lines, and with that killer left foot of his, it is a troublesome task stopping him in front of the net. His goal marks number 17 on the season and puts him just two goals shy of Jamie Vardy at the top of the league. If Liverpool can continue playing as they did today it is clear that Salah will be given ample opportunity to find the back of the net. With 8 games left for each team, it will be a race to the finish to see who the top scorer is.

    <h10><b>4. Wilfried Zaha’s Injury Creates a Hole in Palace’s Attack</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Fifteen minutes into the match, Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha went down with a calf injury and was forced to leave the pitch. Having played in every match this season, Zaha is a key to Palace’s offense and a tactical asset with his ability to play both up top and out wide. While he only has 3 goal contributions this season, his presence and passing ability up top is vital for Palace as they look to fight for a chance at Europa League football next season. Initial signals from the locker room indicate that it is only a calf muscle strain and that he will not be out for very long, but every game he is not on the pitch puts Palace at an immediate disadvantage. With less than 10 matches remaining and seven points needed to get into the top six, it is crunch time for Crystal Palace.

    <h10><b>5. Liverpool’s Win Sets the Stage for Title Bout Against Current Holders Manchester City</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With their win today, Liverpool move just two points away from securing their first title in 30 years. Current title holders Manchester City are the only thing standing in their way, and as long as City don’t drop points to Chelsea tomorrow, Liverpool will travel to Manchester with the ability to win the title on City’s home turf. With Liverpool’s 4-0 win today and City’s 5-0 crushing of Burnley on Monday, both teams have shown that they are ready to bring the energy for the matchup. Even though Liverpool can still win the title if they drop points to City, manager Jurgen Klopp has made it more than clear how bad he wants this victory for his club. They will have to beat the best to be the best, and all eyes will be on the Etihad Stadium as the teams gear up for this heavyweight bout.
