      The Champions League quarter finals kicked off on Wednesday with a thrilling 2-1 win for PSG. Atalanta led 1-0 for 64 minutes before two late goals from Paris stole the show. Much was made of the lack of success in the Champions League for PSG but their narrowly avoided defeat appears to have shifted the narrative in their favor. It was a classic David and Goliath matchup with Atalanta’s squad worth $288 million compared with PSG’s squad worth of $882 million according to Transfermarkt. Here we will look at the tactical battle between the sides and why the two halves were so different along with a focus on Atalanta’s pressing.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h10>Lineup: PSG</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-2.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:45%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 30px;">

    <h13>
      Kylian Mbappe didn’t start due to injury and Angel Di Maria was ineligible due to a suspension. Manager Thomas Tuchel decided to let Neymar have a free role up top and stuck Mauro Icardi on the right wing. Because PSG were decimated with injuries it made sense to have Neymar run the show but Icardi and Sarabia were nowhere to be found the entire match.    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Ander Herrera struggled in midfield under the pressure of Atalanta and failed to provide a creative outlet. Idrissa Gueye had a few bright spots and was able to break the Atalanta press with a combination of dribbling and line-breaking passes. PSG’s backline was under pressure for the first half but there were no significant errors from anyone. At the number six position, Marquinhos was frequently the subject of pressure from Papu Gomez. The Brazilian defensive midfielder looked uncomfortable at times and struggled to be the midfield engine that PSG required in the first half.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The front three of Atalanta caused a lot of problems for PSG’s midfield and I think PSG would have been better served using a double pivot to counter the opposition threat. Herrera, Gueye and Marquinhos are relatively uncreative midfielders so why not play Leandro Paredes alongside Marquinhos as defensive midfielders to add more structure? This would allow Gueye or even Julian Draxler to play ahead as a central midfielder who could actually distribute the ball. The introductions of Kylian Mbappe and (surprisingly) Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting changed the game for PSG. Both were significant upgrades as wingers compared to Sarabia and Icardi because of their direct style of play.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Tuchel was right to play Neymar centrally but he was too rigid in his selection and setup of his midfield. In the next round, PSG will face RB Leipzig who has one of the most tactically advanced managers in the game in Julian Nagelsmann. The return of several players will help Tuchel in the semi finals but this match against Atalanta should make him see the perils of playing a team devoid of identity.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h10>Lineup: Atalanta</b></h10>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-3.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:45%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 30px;">
    <h13>
      Atalanta and manager Gian Piero Gasperini stuck to their guns and it almost worked. I <i>Nerazzurri</i> came out firing with five shots in the first 26 minutes including a beautiful one-time curling goal from Mario Pasalic. They played their typical 3-4-2-1 with aggressive pressing all around the pitch.
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The absence of Josip Ilicic (due to personal reasons) was felt especially in the second half where they lacked a creative presence and had little to turn to off the bench. Wingbacks Gosens and Hateboer played high up the pitch which pinned PSG deep in their own half. Center back Djimsiti was extremely aggressive in his pressing of PSG’s midfield as demonstrated by his average position which was at the halfway line according to WhoScored.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Duvan Zapata was a solid threat in the first half but dropped off after half time. Papu Gomez and Pasalic befuddled the PSG defense and midfield with their fluid movement and aggressive play in the first half.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Gasperini recognized that their aggressiveness in the first half had left them vulnerable to PSG once the press was broken so Atalanta was far more conservative in the second half, only pressing when PSG crossed the halfway line. This invited pressure from PSG but it was the right call, Atalanta would have likely been exposed on the break if they hadn’t changed their mentality. This match was a heartbreaking end to a Cinderella run but Atalanta played as well as they could’ve expected. They outperformed PSG for more than a half of football and were minutes away from the semi finals. Gasperini did almost everything right and victory was still snatched away. Hopefully this isn’t the last we see of Atalanta, their free flowing style was a breath of fresh air in this sterilized environment of modern football.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>Atalanta Press</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Atalanta’s press usually made PSG go backwards, which seemed to frustrate the Parisians, especially after they conceded. Occasionally, Atalanta would force a turnover which led to a dangerous attack or PSG would break the press and have a break of their own. Let’s look at some examples of each:
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>PSG Turnover</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Below, Thiago Silva (in red circle) is relaxed on the ball because he is afforded time and space. In reality, Atalanta is preparing to engage in a press by cornering the ball onto the right sideline.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-4.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Silva is shepherded into playing the ball to Juan Bernat who will be immediately under pressure from Hateboer. From there Bernat will have limited options because every PSG player is man-marked by an Atalanta player.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-5.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Bernat chooses to play his only real option in Gueye. As you can see, Gueye is being tracked by an Atalanta player who is preparing to make a challenge.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-6.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Gueye just barely got a touch to redirect it to Herrera who now has no option but to try and dribble out. Herrera ends up taking a poor touch and turns the ball over. Atalanta quickly builds up into PSG’s half. This sort of intense man-to-man pressing was highly effective but tired out the players quickly.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-7.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">


    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>PSG Break the Press</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Below, Gueye recovers the ball from an Atalanta attacker and quickly swings it to an open Herrera, now Atalanta are in trouble. Their initial attempt to win back the ball has failed.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-8.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Herrera has time and space and spots an open Neymar. The Atalanta defenders were caught flat footed and are now playing catch up, which is difficult when pressing. This sort of reactionary pressure drags players out of position.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-9.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, the center back Caldara is late to challenge, which allows Neymar to turn and survey the field. Neymar creates space in behind by coming deep to receive the ball. The left back Bernat sees the space and makes a brilliant overlapping run down the left wing.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-10.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Neymar delivers the pass and Bernat is in on goal. These sort of opportunities for PSG forced Atalanta to play more conservatively after halftime especially because they were guarding a 1-0 lead.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-11.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">


    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>PSG Go Backwards</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Below (in red circle) Keylor Navas receives the ball and his immediate options are limited by Atalanta players. Thilo Kehrer (in purple circle) is open on the right wing but Navas decides against playing the more risky aerial ball.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-12.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Navas plays the ball to Herrera (black arrow) who checks in to provide an option but is closely tracked by Remo Freuler. Gosens moves in on the right wing to cover Kehrer.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-13.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:35px;">

    <h13>
      Below, Herrera is quickly put under pressure and has to play the way he is facing, all the way back to Navas. His other options are all covered by Atalanta players. Although Atalanta didn’t win the ball back they didn’t have to. PSG struggled to get out of their own half of the field before halftime.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <img src="../blog-img/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg/tactical-analysis-atalanta-vs-psg-14.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:90%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">

    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>Conclusion</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Atalanta press was highly effective in the first half and created several opportunities off of PSG turnovers. However, the intense nature of pressing tired out the Atalanta players and also created dangerous chances for PSG once the press was broken. Their ability to break the press was especially dangerous once Mbappe came on and had space to run behind.
    </h13>
    <br></br>

    <h13>
      With the luxury of a 1-0 lead Gasperini had Atalanta drop back into a back five and tried to see the game out. It nearly worked, but individual talent won out as Neymar and Mbappe were involved with both goals in the dying embers of the match. PSG may have broken a mental barrier in this match but they will have to deal with another pressing team in Leipzig. Atalanta pushed the Parisians to the brink here by putting on a pressing clinic in the first half. It will be interesting to see how Tuchel adjusts his team to deal with the pressure. It seems like pressing is the hot new tactic around Europe now, the question is will individual talent be able to beat the scheme? We’ll find out next week.
    </h13>
