    <h12><b>Final Score: RB Leipzig 2 - 2 Hertha Berlin</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Leipzig failed to overtake Dortmund for second place in a disappointing 2-2 draw against Hertha Berlin. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Set-Pieces Continue to Prevail in Bundesliga?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Has the COVID outbreak resulted in players losing their ability to effectively strike the ball from open play? It definitely seems so, as this match is yet another case of one dominated by set-pieces. The first half saw both teams each score a corner kick goal, followed by a second-half which consisted of a goal from the penalty spot for Hertha and a goal from open play resulting from a goalkeeping error for Leipzig. This theme has been prevalent throughout most of the matches that have occurred post-restart in the Bundesliga, and it shows the importance of not losing focus during simple set-piece plays and taking the time to improve finishing. Even in this match, great opportunities from both sides were squandered. It is also important to note that Christopher Nkunku of Leipzig notched his 13th assist of the season with his corner. He is behind only Jordan Sancho of Dortmund and Thomas Müller of Bayern Munich in assists this season.

    <h10><b>2. Timo Werner Consistency Slipping?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Werner recently took over the headlines as a major transfer target for Europe’s top teams and has even caught the attention of the likes of Liverpool. He has scored consistently throughout this season and has racked an impressive 24 goals. His form in the league has slipped in the past couple of months, however, with him sporadically scoring since the beginning of the year. He was able to notch a hat trick last week, but his performance against Hertha consisted of multiple losses of position and disappointing offensive coordination. On the bright side, Werner shows the excellent offensive presence in positioning himself both on the wings and in the center of the offensive third. Only time will tell whether he can continue to show his quality to attract big clubs.

          <h13>
            Exhibiting the desperation of a team fighting relegation, Bremen started the game strongly and dominated the ball in the first half. Each time Schalke won the ball, Bremen immediately pressured as a team and regained control. Deep into the first half, Bremen still had over 70% possession. As a result, Schalke’s wingbacks, Jonjoe Kenny and Juan Miranda were pinned back and unable to attack in wide areas. In response, Schalke switched to a back four after halftime and attempted more crosses into the box. However, Bremen’s collective defending was extremely effective, and Schalke was unable to manufacture any clear cut chances during the match.

    <h10><b>4. Lookman Impresses Off the Bench</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Former Everton winger Ademola Lookman brought back offensive energy for Leipzig in the second half of this encounter. It is apparent that Leipzig’s creativity up top isn’t quite what it used to be earlier in the season. Lookman’s pace, presence on the ball, and playmaking abilities showed as he inspired his side’s performance in the offensive third. Unfortunately, it was apparent that defending wasn’t the winger’s strong suit as he ended up giving away a penalty in the late stages of the game that led to Hertha equalizing. With Leipzig’s recent drop in form, Lookman could be introduced as a more involved asset to the squad.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Leipzig Squander Any Chance at the Title</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With Bayern’s victory on Tuesday against rivals Dortmund, the German giants cemented their place at the top with a 7 point gap. Leipzig had the chance to jump Dortmund in the table with a victory against Hertha, but they end the day 12 points behind the leaders. They will undoubtedly be kicking themselves at the fact that two major factors of the game were silly fouls: the nonsensical foul from Marcel Halstenberg resulting in a red card, and the extremely late challenge in the box from Ademola Lookman.
