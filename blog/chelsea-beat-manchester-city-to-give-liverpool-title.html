      <h12><b>Final Score: Chelsea 2 - 1 Manchester City</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In an exciting match, Chelsea defeated Manchester City 2-1 to clinch what was an increasingly inevitable title for Liverpool. American starlet Christian Pulisic opened the scoring to put Chelsea ahead 1-0 at halftime. However, City surged to begin the second half and tied the game on a beautiful Kevin De Bruyne free-kick. In the end, the introduction of Tammy Abraham drove Chelsea to a victory sealed by a Willian penalty given away by Fernandinho, and Liverpool finally ended their Premier League title drought.

      <h10><b>1. Pulisic the Star Man</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        On the back of his goal in Chelsea’s previous match against Aston Villa, Christian Pulisic turned in another fantastic performance. Pulisic was bright and direct throughout, and created Chelsea’s first chance after a neat give and go with Giroud that led to a Willian-won corner. In the 36’ minute, Pulisic pounced on a miscommunication between Benjamin Mendy and Ilkay Gundogan to dribble from inside his own half and slide the ball past an isolated Kepa. In the second half, Pulisic continued to lead the Chelsea attack and would have had a hat trick if not for a sliding goal-line clearance by Kyle Walker and a point black block from Fernandinho. If Pulisic continues his great form, he will make a strong case to start for Chelsea next season, alongside new additions Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.

      <h10><b>2. Contrast in Goalkeeper Distribution</b></h10>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Although both teams liked to build their attack from the defence, the distribution ability of their respective goalkeepers created differences in how this was possible. Throughout the match, Manchester City was willing to pass back to Ederson from long distances, knowing his accurate and powerful left foot could quickly restart their offense. In contrast, Kepa’s shaky distribution, evidenced by multiple poor clearances in the first 15 minutes, forced Chelsea to build primarily through their center backs and holding midfielders. Although Kepa has world-class reflexes, in order to become a top goalkeeper, he must add a wider passing range to his arsenal.

      <h10><b>3. Kyle Walker’s Versatility</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although Walker started the game at right-back, his movement during the match exemplified Pep Guardiola’s positional fluidity in his system. In addition to playing as a traditional right-back, Walker also operated as the right center back in a back three, a center back in a back four when Aymeric Laporte drifted to the left, and even as a holding midfielder when City pushed forward. Although City had an uncharacteristically sloppy game defensively, this was not attributed to Walker, who was defensively sound, and also used a brilliantly timed sliding challenge to deny Pulisic in the 71’ minute. Despite always having unique physical gifts of pace and strength throughout his career, Walker has greatly improved his technical ability while at Manchester City to become one of the league's best all-around defenders.

      <h10><b>4. Chelsea Strong in Middle of Defense</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although Manchester City dominated possession in typical fashion, Chelsea defended resiliently as a team to prevent their opponents from having many clear chances. Despite having possession in wide areas, Manchester City was unable to find their usual space inside the penalty area to use quick passing to create open shots at goal. Despite offering little in attack, Chelsea’s two deeper midfielders, N’Golo Kante and Mason Mount had a great defensive work rate and shielded the Chelsea back four well. Additionally, their strong ability on the ball allowed Chelsea to play out of the back and provided key moments of respite for a side with only 33% possession.

      <h10><b>5. Abraham the Difference Maker</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite a valiant effort, Chelsea’s starting striker, Olivier Giroud, was unable to make an impact on the game. However, the introduction of Tammy Abraham rejuvenated Chelsea’s attack and drove them to victory. Immediately after coming on, Abraham’s press created a chance in the 63’ minute for Mount, but his shot went wide. In the 76’ minute, a well-timed run into the box forced an elastic save from Ederson, but Abraham’s hustle to attack the rebound led to a handball by Fernandinho, and gave Willian the opportunity to give Chelsea the lead with a well-taken penalty. Although he only played for a short amount of time, Abraham demonstrated his physicality and pace and made a strong case to start in Chelsea’s key upcoming game against Leicester City.
