      <h12><b>Final Score: Orlando City 1-2 Portland Timbers</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The MLS is Back Tournament has finally come to a close, and it has been a resounding success for the league. Although two teams weren’t able to make it, the bubble worked perfectly and we finally got a good amount of MLS since the season ended last November. Though the final may not have been as exciting as some had hoped, the tournament as a whole ended up being a huge win for the league. Here are five key takeaways:

  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>1. The Tournament Ends With A Fizzle</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        You would think that the final of the tournament would be the match with the most energy, the most sharpness, and the most tension. But for whatever reason - be it exhaustion from playing so many games in such a short amount of time or from playing in the Florida heat when you aren’t used to it - this game just didn’t have that excitement you’d hope for when a trophy, and a Champions League spot, is on the line. There was so little energy, so little movement from both teams, that the game at points seemed like a walkthrough. I know Portland haven’t been a press heavy team in this tournament, but it was not fun to see Nani standing with the ball at midfield for ten seconds because Portland wouldn’t press him and his teammates wouldn’t move to get open. There’s been plenty of exciting matches throughout this tournament, but it was a shame it had to end with this one.

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>2. Orlando Fail To Create Much Of Anything</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Another reason this game was so dull was despite Orlando’s possession dominance they hardly looked threatening in the entire match. Though they did manage 14 shots, they only managed one on target - which they scored - and managed a measly 0.53 expected goals from those shots - that’s less than 0.04 xG per shot for those not doing the math (wyscout.com). They struggled to make an impression in Portland’s third, partly because of the lack of movement but also because of a lack of really penetrative passing into the box. Instead, they settled for low percentage shots that couldn’t find the target, and they were never really a threat to win the game.
      </h13>

  <!-- 3rd Row -------------------------------------------------->
  <section class="articles-white">
    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>3. Set Pieces The Key To Portland’s Success</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With how stagnant the game looked in open play, it always seemed like it would be decided via set-pieces. Diego Valeri ended up being the hero as he helped create both goals via set-pieces. The first he was directly involved in, assisting Larrys Mabiala’s header from an excellent free-kick. The second was indirect involvement, but still important nonetheless, when his corner found an open Eryk Williamson whose shot eventually fell to Dario Zubaric to finish from close range. There was some questionable defending on the second goal from Orlando when Nani stayed on the line instead of pressing Zubaric, which both left Zubaric free to get a shot off and played him onside. Whether that’s something Oscar Pareja wanted him to do I don’t know, but what we can takeaway is that in a slow, tight game such as this set-pieces may be able to provide a breakthrough.

      <br></br>
      <h10><b>4. MLS Is A League That Needs Fans</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        This is something I felt throughout the tournament, but it really felt apparent for the final. I think that with fans in attendance, it would have given the players a bit of an energy boost and we might have had a more lively game than we ended up getting. It’s the unfortunate consequence of the bubble that a league like MLS - one that thrives so much off of its fan culture and the atmosphere of its stadiums - loses a huge part of its identity, and I think you could see that in some of the play Tuesday night. We’ve seen some similar things going on in USL where teams that derive so much energy from their home field advantage - like Louisville City - are struggling early so far without full crowds. We don’t know how long it will be until we can safely get stadiums with full crowds again, but until then don’t be surprised if the on-field product isn’t as good as it normally is.

      <h10><b>5. We Should Have More Knockout Tournaments Like This… Oh Wait, We Do</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        There have been plenty of takes on social media calling for there to be a tournament like this to kick off every year of MLS. Everyone love knockout tournaments, and for good reason. They are exciting, and they’re a fun way to determine things like Champions League spots. What’s the problem with all of these takes? We already have that, it’s called the US Open Cup. The reason a lot of people don’t pay attention to it, however, is because MLS teams often don’t field their best lineups in these games. I’ve never understood why because there’s a Champions League place up for grabs, but fans giving it more love and attention might be a way to signal to teams that they should be giving their all in that competition. It’s also the perfect way to boost up teams from the lower divisions because they also have the chance to compete against the top teams - something they wouldn’t get to do in the normally closed structure of American soccer. If you’re wanting more knockout-style tournaments because of the MLS is Back tournament, the Open Cup is the perfect competition to get that fix.
