      <h12><b>Arsenal: Bukayo Saka, 18, LW/LB/RW/LM/CAM</b></h12>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Those are not typos. Bukayo Saka has really been deployed at all five of those positions this season. The 18-year-old Swiss Army Knife has burst onto the scene this season from Arsenal’s academy with 15 goal contributions. The sacking of Unai Emery was the culmination of a turbulent first half of the season for Arsenal and Saka has been one of the only bright spots in one of the Gunners worst seasons in recent history.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              His tactical versatility as a left back and winger is similar to Bayern Munich left back Alphonso Davies who is a frontrunner for the Golden Boy award. Saka isn’t on the same level as Davies yet but it seems like Saka is poised to become an even more integral player for Arsenal.
              For all of Saka’s versatility (some Arsenal fans on Twitter even want him to play as a number 8) I believe his best position is on the wing. He loves to take defenders on and his pinpoint crossing is an incredible asset for Arsenal’s center forwards, Saka also isn’t afraid to shoot himself, he has had several blinding strikes this season.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Capable of providing cover to rising star Kieran Tierney at left back he is an incredible asset for manager Mikel Arteta. My only concern is Arteta will just use him as a stopgap to plug any holes in the squad rather than allowing him to focus and flourish in a single position.
              <br></br>
              Arteta seems to be the right man for the Arsenal job and I hope he can get the best out of his young star. Saka will likely have an opportunity to make a bigger impact on Arsenal next season with teammates Pierre Emerick-Aubamayeng and Alexandre Lacazette’s future up in the air.

              I was originally considering limiting this list to players who are U-23 but that would exclude 24-year-old Jack Grealish who is undoubtedly the most promising player for The Claret and Blue.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Grealish has an impressive seven goals and six assists in his debut Premier League campaign. He has been the lone bright spot in an otherwise punishing season in the top flight for Villa.
              <br></br>
              Grealish’s quickness and vision makes him an incredibly dangerous player who opponents often key on. He is the most fouled player in the Premier League this season, which is a compliment of sorts.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The attacking midfielder/winger has been heavily linked to Manchester United after leading his boyhood club to the Premier League. Grealish showed United what they are missing with a curler goal into the top corner at Old Trafford back in December 2019. Aston Villa are currently in 18th place and a point from safety. If they are relegated, Grealish could be available for well below his market value this summer.

              David Brooks moved from Sheffield United in 2018 for a fee of $12.4 million. At the time it may have seemed exorbitant for a 21-year-old Championship player, but Brooks proved himself in the 2018/19 season with 7 goals and 5 assists in the Premier League.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              This season he has dealt with an ankle injury that kept him out for nearly a year. The Cherries have sorely missed his creative presence and will need him to return to previous form to avoid relegation.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              When healthy, Brooks is a joy to watch. He has the ability to play the killer pass, dribble past numerous players and finish the attack as well. Brooks likes to cut inside on his left foot before unleashing a shot or sliding a pass in behind.
              <br></br>
              Manchester United were once rumored to be interested in him and with Bournemouth in a relegation battle he could also be available on the cheap if they drop down to the Championship. A return to Sheffield United could be on the cards with the Blades sitting comfortably in 7th place.

      <h12><b>Brighton: Tariq Lamptey, 19, RB/RM (not enough data for radar)</b></h12>
      <br></br>



            <h13>
              Brighton’s resurgence this season under new manager Graham Potter has allowed them to avoid a relegation scrap like last season. Potter’s progressive approach gets results without compromising on style.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              New signing Tariq Lamptey left Chelsea for the promise of more playing time. Brighton fans are delighted with his talent, Reddit user sounders1974 said “Lamptey is unlike any Albion player I have ever seen. We just don't see players with that speed and skill at our club.” Standing at just 5’3 he makes up for his lack of height with blinding quickness and an impressive passing range. Lamptey’s low center of gravity allows him to fend off challenges when dribbling and he is a competent tackler as well.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The Brighton fan on Reddit said it best, talents like Lamptey don’t often end up at Brighton especially not from a top six side. Brighton signed him for $3.63 million, a move that already looks like a bargain. Lamptey has enormous potential and I have confidence that his manager can get the best out of him.

              Industrious is probably the best adjective to describe Burnley’s style of play. Manager Sean Dyche prefers an old fashioned 4-4-2 formation with a direct style of play.

            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Dwight McNeil gives The Clarets some much needed flair on the left wing. He uses his left foot to whip in crosses to Burnley’s forwards and has a calm demeanor on the ball. His burst of pace and dribbling ability makes him a dangerous presence on counter-attacks. His left foot is a weapon, he can float crosses, ping driven balls, chip through balls and hit a variety of shots. It’s like watching a golfer with an extraordinary short game.
              <br></br>
              McNeil is also a dead ball specialist who is not afraid to shoot from 30+ yards. His style of play reminds me of Erik Lamela, with silky dribbling and an outstanding left foot. He has been linked with Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle United. With two goals and six assists this season in the Premier League he isn’t the total package yet, but he’s well on his way to a top six side.

              Timo Werner would have been my choice if I was looking at next year’s squad. But since I chose to look at this season’s team it came down to Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi.
              Pulisic has broken into the starting eleven for Chelsea often this season unlike Hudson-Odoi who has dealt with injury issues. Pulisic also is more of a goal scoring threat with seven goals in 20 Premier League appearances compared with just one goal in 30 for Hudson-Odoi. At 19-years-old Hudson-Odoi still has so much room to grow and he has the potential to be an all around star with his passing range. Pulisic though has burst onto the scene after a slow start in London, even when he doesn’t score he makes an impact.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              He has been the Blues’ best player since the restart and has even drawn comparisons to former Chelsea star Eden Hazard with his mazy dribbling and eye for goal. Manager Frank Lampard gushed about Pulisic’s ability after their recent win over Watford saying “He was playing very well, he got injured at the start of January and he’d been injured until the restart. But what he looks now is sharp and hungry and his quality is there for everyone to see at the moment.”
              The sky seems to be the limit for the American and Chelsea are primed for a successful season in 2020/21 with Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz potentially joining the squad. Pulisic has already proved he can be one of Chelsea’s best players, now he’ll set his sights on being among the best in England.

      <h12><b>Crystal Palace: Max Meyer, 24, CAM/CM/LM (not enough data for radar)</b></h12>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Crystal Palace have the oldest squad in the Premier League with an average age of 29 and their youngest player is Jaïro Riedewald at 23-years-old. Max Meyer is the second youngest on the team and was once linked to clubs such as Liverpool, Arsenal and Bayern Munich while playing for Schalke in the Bundesliga.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Once dubbed the “German Messi” he has played for the German national team and moved to Selhurst Park in a surprising free transfer that has not exactly gone to plan. Under manager Roy Hodgson the Eagles are a pragmatic and compact side not known for creativity. Meyer plays best when he has the freedom to roam the midfield, a privilege not given by Hodgson. He is known for playing the final pass and carrying the ball upfield. If you look on YouTube you literally cannot find any Max Meyer Crystal Palace highlights because he has been on the bench so often.
              For Meyer to revive his career he needs to leave Crystal Palace and find a team who actually play with an attacking midfielder. If he finds the right club, Meyer can be an incredible asset. I would expect Meyer to move back to Germany where the goals flow more freely than England. With his valuation at just $8.8 million this could be a bargain deal for the right club.

              Since arriving at Goodison Park in 2018, Richarlison has been linked with a move to one of Europe’s elite clubs in England and elsewhere. The Brazilian striker has reached new heights at Everton with 24 goals in 65 appearances and the best may be yet to come.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The versatile forward has the typical flair of a Brazilian attacker but isn’t afraid to get physical with defenders too. With pace, strength and a poachers instinct he truly is a complete forward with world class potential. He has the ability to finish with both feet and his head and enjoys taking defenders on in a direct fashion. Even more impressive is the fact that he has broken into the Brazilian senior team with six goals in 19 appearances.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              With new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Everton may finally be on the right track towards European football. Richarlison said it’s an “honor” to be coached by the veteran Ancelotti and he has combined with teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin for 10 goals since the new gaffer arrived.
              Barcelona reportedly had a $106 million bid rejected by Everton for Richarlison, if the giants keep knocking it may be hard to keep Richarlison at Everton. Which makes it imperative that the Toffees qualify for European football as soon as possible, Richarlison will not hesitate to leave if Everton are stuck in mid-table finishes and mediocrity.

      <h12><b>Leicester City: Caglar Söyüncü, 24, CB (not enough data for radar)</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <div class="row-articles">

            <h13>
              This was a tough choice, James Maddison certainly has an argument as does Wilfried Ndidi. But  Caglar Söyüncü has shown the most potential to be world class. He has started 31 of the 33 Premier League games at center back, a major reason why Leicester have the second least goals conceded in the league.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              After the transfer saga and eventual departure of center back Harry Maguire to Manchester United last summer many questioned who would take his place. It turns out that Leicester already had his replacement waiting in the wings. Söyüncü was signed from SC Freiburg in the Bundesliga back in August 2018 for $23.2 million.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              His first season in the Premier League allowed him to adjust to England and he didn’t look back after winning the starting job. If Maguire was worth $95 million then Söyüncü should be valued close to that figure (assuming the transfer market rebounds).
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              He has the pace to keep up with wingers, the strength to hold off strikers, a range of passing to build attacks and a sense of anticipation that is key for defenders. Leicester City will likely qualify for the Champions League this season and Söyüncü is a big reason why.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Söyüncü is enduring a dip in form but he has shown the ability to be a top center back this season. Leicester should be wary though, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him lured to a bigger club in the future.

              It was easy to overthink this one. Trent Alexander-Arnold is worth $108.9 million according to Transfermarkt and it almost felt like a cop out choosing one of the best right backs in the world. But Alexander-Arnold is not done improving yet. He has 12 assists this season, second best behind Kevin De Bruyne at 17, I expect Trent to break 20 assists next season in the Premier League. Liverpool’s attack is already reliant on him and with their front three aging I expect the Reds to lead their attacks through him even more in the future.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Oh and by the way, right back might not even be his best position. We’ve seen Phillip Lahm in the past and now Joshua Kimmich move from right back to defensive midfield due to their ball playing prowess and it appears that Alexander-Arnold is cut from the same cloth. He used to play in the midfield for Liverpool’s youth teams. Imagine a future iteration of Liverpool where Alexander-Arnold is allowed to sit deep in the midfield and ping balls all around the pitch. It’s a scary thought for the opposition's back lines.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              At 21 years old I don’t believe we’ve seen the best of Trent yet and it will be interesting to see how his game evolves over time. There’s no guarantee that he will keep improving in a linear fashion, but under manager Jurgen Klopp I have confidence that he will keep looking for ways to enhance his skillset.

              Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said Phil Foden is “the most talented player” he has ever seen. High praise from a manager who has coached some of the greatest players of all time such as Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and many others.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Foden rose from Manchester City’s academy to the senior team at just 17-years-old. Foden has only made 37 appearances in the Premier League for the senior team but he has shown tantalizing potential in his opportunities. Seen as the heir to David Silva in an “attacking eight” role he has also been utilized on both wings.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              If someone watched Foden play with no knowledge of his background they might suggest he hailed from the Spanish region of Catalonia rather than industrial Manchester. His technical ability makes him a perfect match for Guardiola’s system and with Silva leaving the Etihad this summer Foden is poised to have a breakout season in 2020/21. Since the return of the Premier League he has started three of the six games and scored four goals and one assist.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Guardiola’s comments raised eyebrows around the football world, surely Messi the greatest of all time is more talented than Foden. But regardless of whether you believe Guardiola, Foden has the potential to become one of the top players in the Premier League. The road to becoming a top player is littered with obstacles, but Guardiola’s own assessment has to have some value. I believe it’s a question of when and not if we will be talking about Foden in the same breath as the world’s elite players.

              It was easy to scoff at Manchester United fans who claimed Mason Greenwood was the next coming of Robin van Persie. They were wrong. I believe Greenwood has the potential to be even better than the legendary van Persie.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The 18-year-old Greenwood truly is a two footed player, his finishing has been breathtaking this season. He has 15 goals and 5 assists in all competitions in 2019/20, his form since the restart has been scintillating as well with four goals and an assist in six appearances.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The most remarkable statistic, aside from his age, is Greenwood’s overperformance of xG, he has a cumulative xG of 2.99 in the Premier League and he has scored 9 goals. His conversion rate of 27.7% is in the 99th percentile of forwards in the top 5 leagues in Europe according to <a href="https://www.footballslices.com/" style="color:#25528f"><u>footballslices.com.</u></a> You are genuinely surprised when he doesn’t score on a shot anywhere near the box. His current finishing rate is likely unsustainable, but even if he regresses he will be among the elite finishers in the world. Greenwood has pace, dribbling ability, good instincts and his aforementioned finishing prowess — he really is the total package.

              This was more difficult than it may have seemed. Sean and Matty Longstaff are the two other obvious candidates. Matty Longstaff was actually called the most talented player in Newcastle’s squad by his teammate Jetro Willems and Matty’s debut goal against Manchester United was an incredible moment. Sean Longstaff has been rumored to be a Manchester United target since he broke into the senior team. But Allan Saint-Maximin is a different type of talent.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              His dribbling and pace are arguably the best in England. His end product while still not consistent is improving. He has been Newcastle’s most important player this season after moving from Nice last summer and he has been linked with Napoli, Arsenal, Tottenham and PSG after his hat trick of assists against Bournemouth. His direct, explosive style of play has made him a fan favorite in Newcastle and he has tallied four goals and seven assists in all competitions this season.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The tools at Saint-Maximin’s disposal are applicable to nearly every team. His decision making in the final third has been questioned in the past although his form since the restart has quieted some of the doubters. Now one of the most exciting players to watch in the Premier League, Saint-Maximin has the potential to become one of the most prolific attackers as well.

          Newcastle will be desperate to hold on to him and manager Steve Bruce has insisted he is not for sale at any price this summer. But Saint-Maximin’s brother and agent said his dream is to one day play in the Champions League.
        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          The good news for Newcastle fans is that Saint-Maximin signed a mammoth six year contract last summer and so any club wanting to extricate him from Tyneside will likely have to pay a hefty sum this summer.

              Norwich have a young squad with several promising players including Max Aarons, Jamal Lewis, Emiliano Buendía and Todd Cantwell all of whom are likely to leave the club when Norwich are relegated this season. Buendía and Cantwell are exciting offensive talents but I could see them being lost in the mix at a larger club. Lewis is a well rounded fullback but lacks the physicality and attacking intent needed in the Premier League.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Aarons is a stocky figure who has the potential to fill the do-it-all fullback role that bigger clubs demand. He has been linked with Tottenham, Borussia Dortmund, Manchester United and Crystal Palace. Aarons combines his prolific attacking threat (0.12 xA/90) with solid defensive instincts. His ability to whip in crosses with his right foot reminds me a little bit of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Playing at Norwich his attacking threat is especially impressive and assuming he moves to a larger club this summer he should have less to worry about on the defensive side of things.

      <h12><b>Sheffield United: Sander Berge, 22, CDM/CM (not enough data for radar)</b></h12>
      <br></br>

              It was a bit of a shock move when Sander Berge joined Sheffield this January from Genk. Berge was seen as one of the most promising young midfielders in the world prior to his move to England. His two performances against Liverpool in the Champions League caught the attention of Napoli and Liverpool but the Blades had been chasing his signature since the summer. By January it was clear they were staying in the Premier League and in contention for European football which sealed the deal for Berge.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              At 6’4 Berge is surprisingly agile and glides around the pitch. His passing range is exquisite and he has the ability to score from distance as well. The Norwegian international shares some resemblance to the legendary holding midfielder Sergio Busquets. Berge can play either in a deeper holding position or as a more progressive midfielder, I think as Berge matures his best position will be in a more defensive role. For Berge to adapt to the Premier League he will need to be able to deal with the physicality of playing in the higher intensity midfield. The COVID-19 break seems to have helped Berge become more acclimated to life at Bramall Lane and he scored his first goal for Sheffield against Tottenham on July 2nd.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Sheffield United seem to be on their way to the Europa League for next season and having tasted the possibility of the Champions League this year I expect manager Chris Wilder to have his team in contention again next season. Berge will be instrumental in anything the Blades hope to achieve and I’m sure he will continue to be linked with the Liverpools of the world. For now though, Berge seems content in South Yorkshire and Sheffield fans should be excited for the future.

              Southampton is a well known football factory in England, their academy churns out talent and they also make smart purchases. The Saints are often the last stop for players before moving on to some of Europe’s biggest clubs.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Moussa Djenepo joined last summer from Belgian club Stander Liège for $17.3 million. He was part of Ralph Hasenhüttl’s big summer spend in a bid to revive the club who were nearly relegated last season.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Djenepo has shown flashes of brilliance this season, scoring a brilliant curler last August against Brighton and a solo goal against Sheffield United which won goal of the month. He has also dealt with injuries that have severely limited his game time.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              When fit, Djenepo is a menace for opposing defences. Typically played on the left flank as an inverted winger, Djenepo has a direct style of play. He is a slippery dribbler and uses his burst of pace to cut inside on his stronger right foot.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Djenepo has shadows of former Southampton winger Sadio Mané in his game, if Djenepo can stay healthy he will try to emulate Mané’s path and make a name for himself on the South coast.

      <h12><b>Tottenham: Tanguy Ndombele, 23, CM/CDM</b></h12>

            <h13>
              Tottenham paid $66 million to Olympique Lyon for Tanguy Ndombele in July 2019. It has been a slow transition to the Premier League made worse by former manager Mauricio Pochettino’s sacking mid-season.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Jose Mourinho replaced Pochettino and has had a poor relationship with the French midfielder since the beginning. ESPN reported recently that Ndombele told Mourinho that he never wants to play for him again. Mourinho was also critical of Ndombele’s fitness earlier in the season. Mourinho seems to have a toxic relationship with a player at every club he goes to — regardless of their relationship Ndombele should be starting every game he is fit for Spurs.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              The Frenchman is an elite ball carrier, with the ability to dribble out of tight spaces and pick out any pass. He also isn’t afraid to get stuck in and his passing is usually positive. The double pivot Mourinho prefers is utterly uninspiring when Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko or Eric Dier are paired together, when Ndombele plays he is a breath of fresh air.
            </h13>
            <h13>
              Mourinho’s criticism about his lack of fitness may be warranted but that’s an issue that can be easily resolved. He has all the attributes to become a top player; the only thing holding Ndombele back is his club.

              Ismaila Sarr was a well known wonderkid to FIFA Career Mode fans like myself, which made his $33 million move from Stade Rennais all the more intriguing. As Watford’s record signing the expectations were high, Sarr struggled with injuries and the team got off to a horrendous start and were in last place in December 2019. The Hornets have clawed themselves out of the relegation zone and are six points clear of the drop with three games to play.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Watford’s resurgence has come with an improvement in Sarr’s form as well. He has totaled five goals and five assists in 25 Premier League appearances this season. Two of those goals ended Liverpool’s undefeated season back in January. Sarr drew a crucial penalty on Saturday against Newcastle which Troy Deeney converted for a 2-1 victory.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Sarr has a slender frame but is deceptively strong and quick. He usually plays on the right wing and is capable of accurately squaring the ball to his teammates and slipping teammates in behind. Sarr is a dangerous dribbler and adept at drawing fouls. In some ways he reminds me of Richarlison. Sarr has the potential to be a complete forward and I think he could thrive in a more central role with a fluid attack.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Watford have a talented squad and they really underperformed this season. Manager Nigel Pearson seems to be the right man for the job and Ismaila Sarr will have an even bigger role to play next season. Sarr was linked with Leicester City and Dortmund for a reason, his playmaking ability had scouts salivating when he was in Ligue 1. Like most young wingers he needs to show consistency, which should come with more experience.

              West Ham has a storied academy and Declan Rice is the latest notable graduate. Rice made his debut in 2017 at age 18 and hasn’t looked back. He was named on the PFA Young Player of The Year award shortlist in 2019 falling short to Raheem Sterling. Rice also is a regular international on England’s senior team after switching allegiance from Ireland.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Rice is known for his ball winning ability from a defensive midfield position. He is also a capable passer from deep but specializes in providing cover to the back line. Rice has made several recent appearances at center back out of necessity and has looked more than capable of playing in the back. Rice uses his height and strength to his advantage and center back could be the position of the future for him.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Chelsea and Manchester United have been linked with the 21-year-old and I expect him to make the leap to a bigger club soon with West Ham destined to be mediocre or worse with David Moyes at the helm for the foreseeable future.

              Adama Traoré has been linked with Manchester City and Juventus in recent weeks and Liverpool have been linked in the past. I wrote an <a href="https://michigansoccersociety.com/blog/how-adama-traore-fits-in-liverpool-and-his-potential-replacements" style="color:#25528f"><u>article</u></a> about Traoré recently here’s an excerpt:
              <br></br>
              “The 2019-20 season has been a breakout campaign for Traoré who moved from Middlesbrough in 2018 for a fee of $22 million. At the time his market value was just $8.8 million according to Transfermarkt — but with Traoré his value has always been about his potential not necessarily his current ability.
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Under Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo, Traoré has started to realize that potential and Liverpool have taken notice. He scored both goals in a 2-0 win away at Manchester City in October 2019, a statement victory from Wolves over the defending champions and an incredible display by Traoré himself. His pace, playmaking and crossing makes him incredibly dangerous in open play.”
            </h13>
            <br></br>
            <h13>
              Traoré is an exciting player to watch and it will be interesting to see if/where he moves. The Spaniard is one of the most unique players in football today and it will take a special manager to properly integrate him into their side. Espirito Santo has done an exceptional job of building his team around Traoré and I think he could be well served by staying at Wolves rather than move to a bigger club where he is just another face in a deep squad list.
