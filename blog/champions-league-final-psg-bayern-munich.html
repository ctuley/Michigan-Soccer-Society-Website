      <h12><b>Final Score: Bayern Munich 1-0 PSG</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Bayern Munich are champions of Europe for the first time since 2013 and the sixth time ever. It was a thoroughly dominant Champions League campaign for the German club, winning 11/11 games with a goal difference of +35. They faced their toughest test of the competition in the final, and while PSG were able to keep the game tight, Bayern found a breakthrough to win the game 1-0. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Bayern Munich Are Deserving Champions</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It isn’t often that we get to see the best team in Europe actually win the Champions League. In fact, only five of the last ten Champions League winners have even won their domestic league title. But despite the even more random nature of single-game knockout tournaments, we somehow saw the best possible matchup given the bracket. I don’t think PSG would have been the second-best team on Bayern’s side of the bracket, but their relatively easy draw saw them emerge as the best team from their side. That’s not to say PSG wasn’t a worthy opponent, they absolutely showed they were by keeping Bayern at bay for most of the game. However, the best team in the competition rightly lifted the trophy, and with their record in the Bundesliga, they may have a case for being one of the best teams ever.

      <h10><b>2. PSG Needed More From Their Midfield</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        PSG really could have used a healthy Marco Veratti in this game. His ball retention ability would have been a huge asset against Bayern’s press, and PSG may have been able to control the game earlier. Tuchel didn’t necessarily get his starting tactics wrong - having more defensively adept midfielders in Herrerra and Marquinhos was a better option for their strategy of sitting in the mid to low block and hitting Bayern on the counter - but whenever they needed to progress the ball by playing out from the back, PSG really struggled. Paredes was not good enough, and Veratti came in and put up better progression numbers in 25 minutes than Paredes could in 65. The more defensive midfield also forced Neymar to come deep and do most of the ball progression, and while he still did this very well, he could not influence the game in the final third in the way he really could have - notching up three shots, but no key passes. A healthy Veratti could have helped a lot of these problems, but unfortunately, there’s really nothing PSG could have done about that.

      <h10><b>3. Coman Scores The Winner, But Thiago Is The Difference Maker</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        While Kingsley Coman scored the only goals of the game and gave Thilo Kehrer fits all game, Bayern Munich’s man of the match has to be Thiago. Though he didn’t pick up any goals or assists, Thiago was crucial in Bayern’s buildup play. He was consistently able to retain the ball under pressure, his ability to switch the play helped in beating the press, and his ball progression was off the charts - with 6 progressive passes and 11 passes into the final third. Thiago has been an underrated part of Bayern’s success this season, especially with his lack of minutes post-restart, but when he plays he has shown how good and how important he truly is to their team. He will be missed if he leaves this summer, and though he is 29 years old, whatever club signs him will be gaining a great asset in midfield.

      <h10><b>4. Will PSG Ever Be Able To Get Over The Hump?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        You can’t really say PSG choked this season. They got to the final and lost a close game to a superior team. Yet it almost feels like this team has reached its ceiling. We can see the club’s board seems to believe that too as it is rumored that they want to replace manager Thomas Tuchel. But would any other manager really be able to do more than Tuchel has? This iteration of PSG is on its last legs. Most of their high-minute players are at or on the wrong side of their peak, and the best young talent may want to leave for a new challenge if they don’t feel that they can win the Champions League in Paris. A rebuild definitely looks like it could be the plan at PSG, but they may decide to spend big and try to make the most of Neymar and Mbappe while they still can. They will need to replace and upgrade a lot of pieces in a short amount of time, but if any club has the money to do that, it’s PSG.

      <h10><b>5. Single Game Knockout vs. Two-Leg Knockout</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        A lot of the discourse surrounding this season’s Champions League is whether or not the competition should retain the single-game knockout format going forward. It seemed to be a huge success among fans, giving us plenty of upsets and cutting down on super conservative first legs. However, it is worth remembering all of the excitement two-leg ties gave us just last season. The Manchester City-Spurs, Spurs-Ajax, and Liverpool-Barcelona ties were all super exciting with their great comebacks and late second-leg drama. Personally I like the single-game format better because it seems more conducive to upsets, but I understand why fans of teams in the competition would not want to give up a chance to see their team play at home. Both versions have their pros and cons, and I think fans would be happy either way, but I definitely find myself in the single-game camp right now.
