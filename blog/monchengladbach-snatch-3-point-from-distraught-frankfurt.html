    <h12><b>Final Score: Eintracht Frankfurt 1 - 3 Borussia Monchengladbach</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Two very early goals and a penalty sealed the win for the visitors, and even though Frankfurt tried to come back through an Andre Silva wonder-strike. Here are five key takeaways from today’s match:

    <h10><b>1. Monchengladbach’s Title Hopes Still Very Much Alive</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Fighting for their first title since 1977, Gladbach has done an excellent job of keeping the pressure alive on the Bundesliga title race, having built an incredible group of players over the past few seasons and new manager Marco Rose bringing the best out of the ex-Lille forward and son of French legend Lilian Thuram, Marcus Thuram. The Frenchman continues his hot run of form, with Alexander Plea and a completely reborn Breel Embolo, and they might have a good chance in succeeding the next hurdle at Havertz and Co. in Leverkusen. With Bayern facing Union Berlin and this Frankfurt team next, and Bayern being Bayern, it might be hard to imagine them clinching the league title, but we can be sure if any unexpected mistakes were to happen, they very well could be on their way to their first since ‘77. That would be another milestone for the brilliant Marco Rose, who today is the manager is the most points since 26 games after taking charge.

    <h10><b>2. Can Gladbach Survive Without Denis Zakaria?</b></h10>

            The Swiss international has been the hot topic on this side of the Rhine before his injury and has been tipped for a move to the English Premier League for a while now. It would have been really unlikely for them to keep him at Borussia Park next season, but now with the financial undertones of the corona-crisis, they still might have a slightly higher chance.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            However, if Zakaria were to leave, as today’s match showed with him out being injured, Gladbach is in good hands of a completely reborn Embolo and a good performance by Neuhaus shows they might be on the right track and the loss of Zakaria won’t spell the doom of this team. A fiery Thuram and Plea partnering could prove deadly for any upcoming opposition as it did for Frankfurt today.

    <h10><b>3. Frankfurt and their Goalscoring Woes</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Frankfurt seemed out of the game since the beginning and while their defense was completely sloppy today, with the exception of Hinteregger’s amazing goal-line clearance. They gave the opposition a lot of space to utilize, but another major gap left is perhaps a harder one to fill, one in their attack. They lacked a direction and determination to score until the last 15 minutes with the introduction of Gacinovic, and it was just a onsolation effort rather than a one that would win you a match.
    </h13>
    <h13>
      With last season’s stars, Ante Rebic, Luka Jovic, and Sebastian Haller lured away this past summer, the heights of last season look more and more distant as days go by. With Kostic being the shining knight in the attack for Frankfurt this season, relying on just him is too much of a gamble and like today, when he doesn’t step up like the entirety of the first half and the beginning of the second half, the Frankfurt attack is just, non-existent.

    <h10><b>4. Eintracht Frankfurt Faces Uphill Battle to Stay in Bundesliga</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With Frankfurt just being six points shy of the relegation zone, and their incredibly lackluster display today afternoon, they are in a dangerous position with still eight rounds of play remaining in the Bundesliga. From European heartbreak at the Europa League last season to getting relegated from the Bundesliga, that is a very hard fall. With a rising tally of losses and a disappointing performance at home, going to Munich next weekend to visit the Rekordmeister won’t be a pleasant day, and could possibly be disastrous for their top-flight hopes.
    </h13>
    <h13>
      Even if they survive, they have to fix the gaping holes in their attack and make sure sloppy defensive performances will be as consistent as their performances this season, beating Bayern earlier but losing to teams they shouldn’t. Unless they pull a second miracle against Bayern, they might be heading down from almost European glory to almost Bundesliga.

    <h10><b>5. Soccer is Back - How has the Break Influenced Performances?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With a global pandemic going on, and the coronavirus still going strong in a lot of places, albeit less so in Germany, European football briefly paused for exactly 2 months. It had a lot of effect on so many different places and football was the lowest priority in such a situation. However, the financial destruction left by COVID-19 could still be felt by football, with third-quarter TV earnings in Germany being at stake, which could destroy clubs, with also the added consequence of no fans being allowed in stadiums, reducing matchday revenue.
    </h13>
    <h13>
      On the playing field, however, not many changes could be felt, with the exemption of no fans, and although with a lot of players returning from injuries, not much opportunity was present for teams to change their pre-COVID form. With this break not being like a typical one, with the absence of pre-season friendlies to warm players up and even though training resumed, there wasn’t a lot of things that could have been changed and football picked up from where it was stopped. This could be particularly felt at today’s match at the Commerzbank Arean, with Frankfurt seeming out of sorts, unprepared and continuing their recent bad form, while, Gladbach comfortably winning this match as expected, without any surprises whatsoever.
