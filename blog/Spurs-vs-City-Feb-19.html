      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester City 2 - 3 Tottenham</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester City dominated possession throughout the match, but they failed to convert the majority of their chances. Tottenham, on the other hand, fantastically managed their counter attacks. A 4th minute goal from Dejan Kulusevski and two goals from Harry Kane (in the 59th and 95th minutes) sealed the points for Spurs. City’s goals came in the 33rd minute from Ilkay Gündogan and in the 92nd minute from a Riyad Mahrez penalty.

      <h10><b>1. The title race is back on</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After beating Chelsea 1 - 0 on January 15, 2022, Manchester City had a 13 point lead over the chasing pack. Their lead is now only six points — and second-placed Liverpool has a game in hand. The Reds are also in red-hot form, so every match is now a must-win for Pep’s side. Yes, it is typical for the Cityzens to go on a long winning streak after a disappointing defeat, but that’s not something they should count on to win the title. Jurgen Klopp must be licking his lips at the prospect of closing the gap on City.
        Manchester City is scheduled to play the Reds on April 9, 2022, and it could very well be the title deciding match.

      <h10><b>2. This is the Kane we remember</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Harry Kane had one of his best performances of the season today. He scored two (including the 95th minute winner) goals, had one disallowed, and played an incisive ball to send Son through to assist Kulusevki’s opener. The slightly deeper role suited Kane well as he was constantly playing his teammates in and surging forward to get on the end of crosses. This was a performance from Harry Kane that fans had been missing for a long time. Hopefully it is here to stay.

      <h10><b>3. Applause for the new signings</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Both of Tottenham’s former Juventus boys Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur had good games. The former scored a great goal off Spurs’ fourth minute counter attack and the latter defended well and effectively helped set off the attacking phases. While in a run of poor form, Conte mentioned his regrets in selling players as he thought his squad had weakened, but both Kulusevski and Bentancur surely helped prove their manager wrong. Their performances today truly showed Tottenham fans what they picked up in January.

      <h10><b>4. Spurs still have hope for top four</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        If the Lillywhites play like they did against City for the rest of the season, they should be in top contention for fourth place. They have two or more games in hand over Manchester United, West Ham, and Wolves, and a performance like today’s is capable of beating any of those teams. Arsenal is their closest rival as they’ve played the same number of games, but they should be easily dispatched as well. There won’t be silverware for Tottenham this season, but the future is looking very promising if they keep playing at this level.

      <h10><b>5. Having no striker could be City’s downfall</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester City seems to prove this point wrong time and time again, but they’re lack of a target man was painfully apparent today. They threw countless crosses into the box, but they were just about never met by a head wearing blue. Yes, they signed Julian Alvarez from River Plate this January, but he’s back at the Argentinian side on loan for the rest of the season. Few people will be surprised if another season without a striker proves to be City’s downfall both domestically and on the European stage. Next season should be different, but fans of the Sky Blues should be a bit worried.
