    <h12><b>Final Score: Hertha Berlin 4 – 0 Union Berlin</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Another week, another 4-0 derby thumping. Union Berlin traveled to the Olympiastadion to take on local rivals Hertha Berlin in only the second-ever Bundesliga match between the two sides. It was one of the most anticipated matches of the second weekend of the Bundesliga’s return, but what followed was a second straight week with a one-sided derby match. Here are my five key takeaways:
    </h13>
  </div>

<!-- 1st Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>1. Quick Double Provides Breakthrough Propelling Hertha to Victory</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Much like last weekend’s match against Hoffenheim, it was a couple of goals in quick succession that powered Hertha to victory. The difference lies in the state of each game at the time the goals were scored. Against Hoffenheim, the match had been fairly even throughout the game. Both team’s expected goals were both around 1.00 when Kevin Akpoguma’s own goal broke the deadlock just before the hour mark. The match ended 3-0 to Hertha, but Hoffenheim actually led in expected goals 2.79-1.55 <i>(understat.com)</i>.
    </h13>
    <h13>
      The Berlin derby was a different story. Union kept it scoreless throughout the first half without creating much, but Hertha had a couple of good chances - Matheus Cunha’s backheel flick in the 27’ a particular highlight racking up an xG of 0.48 (understat.com). Hertha didn’t necessarily look dominant, but it did seem a breakthrough was coming. It only took five minutes into the second half for Hertha to find their breakthrough and two goals within minutes of each other sealed Union’s fate. Two more goals - including a particularly impressive one by Matheus Cunha - followed, and Union never stood a chance.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>2. Union Struggle To Find A Spark In Attack</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite the disappointing final score for the mid-table team, Union Berlin should be far from ashamed from their performance on Sunday. While Bayern was able to conjure up a total of 13 shots, with 3 being on target, a huge majority of these opportunities were half-chances at best. The frustration from players like Gnabry, Müller, and Goretzka was apparent as they had shot after shot blocked by the in-form Berlin defense.

<!-- 3rd Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>3. Vedad Ibisevic Gives a Man of the Match Performance</b></h10>
    <br></br>

          <h13>
            The Bosnian striker was always going to be important today, with his aerial ability being useful against a Union Berlin team that is very good in the air. His importance became even more apparent early in the match when Hertha was forced to play long because they were struggling to play out of the back. The 35-year-old captain has struggled for minutes this season, but after a start and a goal against Hoffenheim he found himself in the starting XI again this week. Against Union, Ibisevic scored with his only shot - a header off a cross from Plattenhardt with an xG value of 0.44 - and picked up an assist off of three key passes - with an xA value of 0.82 (understat.com). Although not credited with the assist, Ibisevic was also responsible for the second goal - his through ball for Dodi Lukebakio was deflected before it fell to Lukebakio to finish. A man of the match performance from him today.

    <h10><b>5. Derby Matches Just Won’t Feel the Same Without Fans</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite the commentators’ best efforts to speak the feeling of a derby match into existence, it just didn’t feel the same. Much like the Revierderby last weekend, the experience of watching the Berlin derby suffered from a lack of energy brought by a passionate crowd of supporters. This match felt a bit more physical than the Dortmund-Schalke match - like a derby should be - but I’m attributing that more to Union’s physical style of play than anything else. The one-sided nature of the match once again did not help give it a derby feel. By the time the fourth goal went in, the energy had been zapped out of Union, and any hope for the match to feel like a derby was gone.

    <h10><b>Bonus Takeaway:</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      This is the second week in a row in which I have covered a derby match, and the second week in a row where the home team has won 4-0. For the sake of having competitive matches going forward, I think I will take a break from covering derbies for a while.
