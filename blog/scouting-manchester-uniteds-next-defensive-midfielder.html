    <h13>
      It seems Manchester United are finally firing on all cylinders. After buying Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon in January, and Pogba’s return from injury post-restart, United are looking primed to potentially challenge for the title next season. It may be a bit of a reach given the inconsistencies of their manager, but they certainly have the talent to do it. They are strong in most areas of their team - though they may need to bring in more quality depth - but the question of who should play as the third midfielder behind Pogba and Bruno remains. Nemanja Matić seems to be the preferred option at the moment, but he’ll be 32 next season and United will need a long-term option. Let’s dive into the data to find some potential options:

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Manchester United have three options already at the club to play in that deep lying midfielder position. The age of the three midfielders vary from 23 to 32 years old, and each have their own specific strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps Solskjaer will just want to go with what he has and change the personnel depending on the situation. That’s a perfectly fine solution - the position doesn’t need an upgrade in the short term - but let’s see what options they have:

          <br></br>
          <h13>
            The seven year Premier League veteran has shown his worth since the restart, and has made a good case for why he should be the third midfielder going into next season. His lack of mobility can sometimes be an issue - especially in the more up-tempo style that Solskjaer wants his team to play in - but his positioning allows him to still win the ball back with regularity. His size also allows him to be good in the air, which helps when he drops between the center-backs to form a back three and allows the fullbacks to push up. His ability to pass under pressure makes him a good option when teams like Southampton try to press high against them, but he often doesn’t put much pressure on the opposition himself - as seen in his 48th percentile pressures/90 and 65th percentile pressure regains/90. He would still be a good option for next season, but at 32 years old, he will not be the long term solution.

            In situations where Manchester United need a more mobile, defensively active midfielder, Fred might be a good option for them. He is slightly more of a creative threat than Matić - with 3.42 shot creating actions/90 to Matić’s 2.62 - and gets more involved in the buildup - 0.36 xGBuildup/90 to 0.28 - but he is a much more active presser than Matić. Fred is in the 96th percentile for pressures/90 and 98th percentile for pressure regains/90. He also ranks in the 94th percentile for recoveries/90, 95th percentile for tackles won/90 and 84th percentile for interceptions when adjusting both for possession. He’s a valuable asset to keep around and has shown a lot of quality this season in the double pivot of the 4-2-3-1.

          <h13>
            McTominay is a good young player that could easily develop into something greater, but right now he isn’t United’s best option for that midfield spot. His size is reminiscent of Matić, but his skill set isn’t near as complete - though he does have time to develop it. Like Matić, McTominay isn’t a very active presser without the ball - he’s in the 30th percentile for pressures/90 and 40th percentile pressure regains/90 - but his ability to win the ball back is similar - ranking in the 82nd percentile for interceptions and tackles won when adjusted for possession and in the 89th percentile for recoveries. He’s more conservative in his passing - with fewer shot creating actions, passes into the penalty area, and progressive passes than Matić - but he does progress the ball well by carrying it forward from deep. McTominay is a good player, but he’ll need to develop a wider skill set before he’s ready for that starting role behind Bruno and Pogba.

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Manchester United could go into next season with these three midfielders and be perfectly fine. They might not challenge for the title, but they could give it a go and have enough talent to qualify for the Champions League with ease. However, with Matić at 32 years old, new players will need to be brought in sooner or later for the long term future of this midfield. On top of that, an upgrade in the position could push their talent level up enough to start challenging for the title next season while still having quality depth behind them. Let’s take a look at five midfielders - aged 23 or younger because we’re looking for long term options - that United could take a look at to sign this summer:

          <h13>
            Declan Rice is a bit of a mix between all three of the Manchester United midfielders that I mentioned above. He’s got the conservative passing of Scott McTominay, the active pressing of Fred, and the size and tactical flexibility of Matić. And, at just 21 years old, he’s got tons of time to develop into one of the most complete defensive midfielders in the league. In recent games, Solskjaer has used Matić’s ability to drop between the defenders and play as a third center-back to great success as it allows United’s fullbacks to push upfield while guarding well against counterattacks. Declan Rice would be perfect for this role, as his size not only makes him an excellent option as a defender, but his experience playing in the center-back position could be of great benefit. His ability to play out from the back will also be useful against teams that like to sit deep and force United to break them down - something they’ve struggled against this season. Now a downside is that he would be very expensive. He’s valued at €49.5 million on transfermarkt.com, but a fee much higher than that would likely be needed to pry him away from West Ham. That’s a lot of money for a player that won’t be a finished product right away, but if United see him as a part of their plans for years to come, it could be a worthwhile investment.

          <h13>
            Like Declan Rice, Wilfred Ndidi’s transfermarkt value is a bit misleading as it would likely take a far greater sum to buy him from Leicester City - especially if they qualify for the Champions League. However, his qualities as a defensive midfielder are undeniable. He is extremely good at winning the ball back - he ranks in the 97th percentile for recoveries/90 and 99th for tackles won and interceptions when adjusted for possession - and he’s excellent at sweeping up behind two more attack-minded midfielders. He screens the center-backs well and can drop in between them to allow the fullbacks to push forward. He is conservative in possession, like McTominay, but he does well to recycle possession and keep the ball moving amongst his adept ball-playing defense at Leicester - a similar setup to what he’ll have at United.

            Konrad Laimer was the second most active presser in Europe’s top five leagues last season - second to Bournemouth forward Dominic Solanke, strangely enough. He was absolutely critical to Leipzig’s title challenge and Champions League run this season. He is good with the ball - keeping it well under pressure, but mainly used to recycle possession - but his biggest strength is obviously his defensive capabilities. His movement and positioning off the ball, combined with his always active pressing, make him very good at winning the ball back - he ranks in the 97th percentile for possession adjusted tackles won/90, and the 99th percentile for pressures/90 and pressure regains/90. He’s been compared to N’Golo Kanté, and it’s easy to see why. He’s got an unbelievable engine, and can seemingly cover endless amounts of ground. Behind two very advanced midfielders, that could be invaluable.

            Bennacer is the most interesting option of the five I’ve picked out if United want a player who can progress the ball really well. He has been excellent for AC Milan this season playing in a double pivot with Frank Kessie. He progresses well through his passing - ranking in the 87th percentile for progressive passes per 90 - and carries the ball forward well - he ranks in the 95th percentile for successful dribbles. His dribbling and passing ability also allow him to keep the ball well when under pressure, Bennacer is also very active in the defensive phase - he’s above the 90th percentile in pressures and pressure regains/90 - and is very good at winning the ball back - ranking in the 91st percentile for possession adjusted interceptions, the 98th percentile for possession adjusted tackles won, and the 99th percentile for recoveries. Like Laimer, he could do a very good job sweeping up behind two more advanced midfielders, but his abilities in possession could make him more of a threat in United’s buildup play.

            Eduardo Camavingra may be the young, defensive midfielder from Ligue 1 that’s catching eyeballs at the moment, but if United are looking for some value, Ibrahim Sangaré from recently relegated Toulouse might be a good option for them. Just because a team gets relegated doesn’t mean all of their players are bad - just look at what Liverpool got from Andy Robertson after he was relegated with Hull City. Sangaré could break out in a similar fashion. He’s good on the ball, progressing well through his passing and carrying, and can keep the ball well under pressure. When out of possession, he can use his size and athleticism to pressure the opponent, and is adept at winning the ball back - ranking in the 94th percentile for pressure regains/90, 97th for recoveries/90, and 95th for possession adjusted tackles won/90. He probably won’t be an upgrade on the options United already have in the short term, but long term Sangaré could develop into a great defensive midfielder.
