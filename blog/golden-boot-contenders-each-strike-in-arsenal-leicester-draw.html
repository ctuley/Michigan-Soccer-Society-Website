      <h12><b>Final Score: Arsenal 1 - 1 Leicester City</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In a game with European implications, the match’s excitement did not disappoint. It was a game of two halves with Arsenal being dominant in the first half. In the Second half, Leicester started better by a slight margin, but once Eddie Nketiah got a red card without one touch of the ball Leicester began dominating. It is rare that you come out of a game with both teams believing they should've gone home with three points, but you must feel that Leicester feel the happier of the two teams with the result as going into the second-half water break they seemed unlikely to score a goal.

      <h10><b>1. A Vision of Arsenal’s Future</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        From the very beginning of the match viewers could see that Arsenal came into this match with confidence and belief. After a crucial, momentous win against Wolves last week to begin Arsenal’s run of difficult games over the coming weeks, the confidence gained was clear from the opening whistle. If Arsenal’s win last week was considered conservative on the offensive end, the first half of the Leicester game was anything but. Arsenal looked like an expansive, attacking machine that kept manufacturing chances. If there were any negatives in the first half for Arsenal, it was the lack of clinical finishing as they were only able to score the one goal. They would pay for this in the second half as Arsenal seemed to take their foot off the pedal in the second half, and eventually completely lost control following the red card from a reckless tackle from Eddie Nketiah. If Arteta can find a way to make his team look like they did in the first half for entire matches, Arsenal could begin to be a force to be reckoned with as their young players mature.

              <h13>
                Although Leicester did show bright spots before the Arsenal red card, they truly only began dominating play after Nketiah was sent off. The first half was particularly worrying for the Foxes as they struggled to create chances and get out of their own half. This brings to light the big gap in Leicester lineups that were the recovering Ben Chillwell and James Maddison. With rumors constantly swirling around these two players, tonight created a little sneak peak at what Leicester may look like if these players were sold in the summer. It was clear throughout the first half that Leicester were missing the creative presence of James Maddison as Ayoze Perez stepped into the role of Attacking Midfielder and the pivot of Ndidi and Tielemans were slotted in behind. This threesome struggled to create opportunities in the first half as many of the most dangerous chances were created from passes by Jamie Vardy. The presence of Chillwell was also sorely missed throughout the game as it may have been part of the reasoning behind Leicester playing a back three. If Leicester do decide to part ways with these two players, they are going to need to find quality replacements very quickly as it will be difficult for them to compete against the big boys without their quality.

      <h10><b>3. Ceballos Second Season in the Cards</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Dani Ceballos has been impressive under Mikel Arteta. At the start of Arteta’s reign he was clearly not a favorite player but has been said to be working extremely hard in training and has begun putting good performances in games as well. The complaints from many Arsenal fans is that although he does look like a dominant player in games against poor teams he has not shown up in games against teams in the upper half of the table. This was seen in the two previous games as he was one of the players of the game against a weak Norwich side but became invisible in the game against Wolves. This brings us to tonight. Against a team that, although is going through a poor run of form, is 4th in the table shows he is growing used to the high intensity of the Premier League. He led Arsenal in touches, was second in interceptions, and played the delicious pass to Saka that led to Arsenal’s goal. With Arteta stating his intent to keep Ceballos on multiple occasions and Guendouzi seeming to be on his way out, it is very possible that Ceballos may find himself on Arsenal next year either via another loan or being sold if the price is right.

      <h10><b>4. The State of European Qualification</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The point that Leicester grabbed in this game was absolutely crucial as they have been in a freefall since the restart. Previously looking like a write-in for the Champions League places, a loss to Arsenal could have seen that change dramatically. Although they have fallen behind Chelsea they still seem to be in a good position to be joining the European powerhouses next season, especially if Manchester City’s ban is upheld and the 5th spot in the table is for a Champions League spot. On the Arsenal end of European qualification, they may be thinking that dropping two points in this match may have made the already unlikely possibility of finishing in the Champions League places almost impossible. Europa League on the other hand is a definite possibility with the North London Derby being their next match and Wolves falling closer to Arsenal after their head-to-head last week.

      <h10><b>5. Golden Boot a Two-Horse Race</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Although Danny Ings is only two goals back of Aubameyang and four back of Jamie Vardy, there is a definite feeling that the man who takes home the most goals will be one of the two strikers who played tonight in North London. Aubameyang scored the first goal in the game showing his pace as the late runner coming into the box. Vardy clawed back his two-goal lead in the golden boot race after a wonderfully timed run kept him just onside to tie the game one to one. With only four games left to be played one would think a goal or two more for Vardy would put this race away as Aubameyang would need to put up at least two goals in the last four games to bring home the trophy for the second year running.
