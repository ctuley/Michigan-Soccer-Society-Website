      Dortmund clinch second place in the Bundesliga with a hard-fought win over Leipzig.

    <h10><b>1. Haaland Strikes Again</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      After missing two clear cut chances early, the 19-year-old Norwegian made no mistake with a tidy finish in the 30th minute after a fluid counter attack by BVB. It speaks to his impressive finishing ability that you are genuinely surprised when Haaland doesn’t score a chance. He has compiled 11 goals and two assists in just nine total appearances in the Bundesliga. Just three days earlier, Dortmund were outplayed by Mainz 05 in a 2-0 defeat where Haaland failed to register a single shot. Haaland bounced back with five total shots and four on target against Leipzig. Haaland was constantly asking questions of the Leipzig backline and made the usually unflappable Leipzig center back Dayot Upamecano look uncomfortable. Every Dortmund attack seemed to involve Haaland. His distribution, timing of runs, and pressing were on full display. To cap off the impressive day, Haaland tapped in his second goal in the 93rd minute to seal the victory for Dortmund.

            Timo Werner’s upcoming departure in July to Chelsea will leave a massive hole in the Leipzig squad. Although they have all but secured Champions League qualification for next season, their hopes for this year’s competition are dimmed by Werner's absence. A disappointing draw against Düsseldorf earlier in the week coupled with today’s loss will leave head coach Julian Nagelsmann searching for answers. After cruising past Tottenham in the Round of 16 they will likely have a more difficult matchup in the Quarterfinals with Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich as potential opponents.

    <h10><b>3. Young Americans Steal the Spotlight</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Giovanni Reyna has risen to USMNT relevance this season at Dortmund. The 17-year-old winger/attacking midfielder popped up on the radar after a stunning debut goal in the DFB Pokal and he was slated to start in the first match back without fans but was a late scratch due to injury. He earned his first-ever start this week and repaid his coach Lucien Favre with a brilliant one-time assist to Erling Haaland for the opening goal. Reyna tallied 36 passes and created two chances in an impressive outing. Him and Thorgan Hazard swapped wings consistently causing problems in the Leipzig defense. Leipzig countered with an American of their own: Tyler Adams. The 21-year-old midfielder was subbed on at halftime as Leipzig switched formations and made an instant impact. Leipzig were arguably the better team in the second half with a majority of the possession and even ended up with more shots than Dortmund for the entire game. Adams was instrumental in the second half by providing cover to the backline and was a calm distributor of the ball as well. USMNT fans should take heart in the pair’s impact on the game and the fact that both are receiving significant game time for Champions League clubs.

    <h10><b>4. The Game Within the Game</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The tactical battle between the two coaches was fascinating. Both Julian Nagelsmann and Lucien Favre are known for their tactical prowess and Nagelsmann in particular as a coach who is always tinkering with his lineup. Both teams started with a back three, Dortmund employed a 3-4-3, and Leipzig used a 3-4-1-2. The three attackers for Dortmund: Hazard, Haaland and Reyna were consistently running at the Leipzig defense in transition and frequently had opportunities because the Leipzig wing-backs Angeliño and Mukiele failed to tuck in causing a 3v3 situation between the Leipzig center backs and the Dortmund attackers. Nagelsmann recognized this at halftime and changed his formation to a 4-3-3 subbing off a center back and playing Adams as a holding midfielder. This made it harder for the front three of Dortmund to create chances in transition because Leipzig’s fullbacks were more defensive allowing them to have a numerical advantage over BVB. The introduction of Christopher Nkunku in the second half provided Leipzig a spark due to his attacking prowess and ability to play in multiple positions. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre saw his side under duress and switched to a more defensive 5-3-2 with Sancho being subbed on to lead the line with Haaland. The more conservative formation allowed Dortmund to absorb the Leipzig threat and with Leipzig desperate for an equalizer allowed Dortmund to score the dagger with the last counter-attack of the game.

    <h10><b>5. Julian Brandt the Unsung Hero</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Julian Brandt moved from Bayer Leverkusen last summer to Dortmund, yet another savvy decision from the BVB hierarchy. His versatility is incredible, Brandt has been deployed as an attacking midfielder, on both wings and as a central midfielder this season. Brandt played as a central midfielder today alongside Axel Witsel and was instrumental in both goals. For the first goal, Brand played a clever one-two with Hazard and sprinted down the right-wing with the ball and squared the ball to Reyna who laid it off to Haaland for the goal. On the final attack of the game, Sancho slipped Brandt through before Brandt fired a low cross into Haaland who got the slightest of touches to seal the three points. Haaland’s performance will steal the headlines but without Brandt, those goals don’t happen. At just 24-years-old Brandt is already one of the best and most versatile midfielders in the Bundesliga and the $27.5 million fee Dortmund paid last year is already looking like a bargain.
