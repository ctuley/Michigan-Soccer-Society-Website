      <h12><b>Final Score: Brighton and Hove Albion 0 - 3 Manchester United</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester United improved their streak to 15 games unbeaten in all competitions following a win against Brighton today. The Seagulls had their defense gashed by United’s constant pressure as they were picked apart for three goals while being unable to net any themselves. Here are five key takeaways from the match:

      <h10><b>1. The Duo of Fernandes and Pogba in United’s Midfield is a Force to be Reckoned With</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After being sidelined for months following surgery on his ankle, Paul Pogba is finally returning to United’s starting eleven. Pairing up with United’s new transfer this year of Bruno Fernandes from Portuguese club Sporting CP, the two midfielders have proven themselves as a dynamic duo who will wreak havoc on their opponents. In the 64 minutes that they both saw the pitch, Fernandes scored two goals, the first of which was assisted by none other than Pogba himself. These two confident and talented midfielders allow for United to keep pressure high and let Pogba and Fernandes pick out passes going forward. With this world-class midfield duo and a strong front three, time will only tell how good this United team can be.

      <h10><b>2. Brighton Could be Looking at Relegation this Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>

            <h13>
              Having picked up just one win in 2020, this Brighton side looks in disarray. Their backline was constantly picked apart by United’s attack despite holding a deep line most of the game. One of the only times they pushed up as a team led directly to a swift counter-attacking goal from the team in red, showing just how outclassed Brighton was. Their next matchup against Norwich will prove vital as they look to pick up the three points that could save them from relegation. Dropping points could spell disaster for the club as they look forward to matchups against top sides Liverpool and Man City in the coming weeks. If they want to stay in top-flight English football, Brighton needs to get back on the right course with three points against Norwich this weekend.

      <h10><b>3. Mason Greenwood is a Sign of Good Things to Come for United</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Picking up his 13th goal in all competitions this season and a brilliant assist, 18-year-old Mason Greenwood is solidifying himself as one of United’s best young prospects. Getting a relatively rare spot in the starting lineup, Greenwood quickly established himself showing pace out wide and skill on the ball. His goal in the 16th minute was beautifully crafted as he dribbled past defenders to find the near corner of the net. His assist later showed just how strong and accurate Greenwood’s left foot is as he floated a cross perfectly to Fernandes’s feet for a volley goal. Being just 18 years old, Greenwood is one of many young United players who are beginning to reach their potential. 22-year-olds Aaron Wan Bissaka, Marcus Rashford, and Daniel James all have improved significantly this season and could help lead this United team to some trophies in the next few seasons. Their combination of young talent and established players, such as Pogba, Fernandes, and Maguire, creates a deadly team that could look to make some magic happen next season.

      <h10><b>4. Leandro Trossard is an Underrated Player</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Coming off the bench at halftime, Brighton’s Leandro Trossard quickly showed that he is a key in their attack going forward. Providing a spark down the wing, Trossard contributed to Brighton's first promising attacks of the game, nearly beating De Gea for a far-post goal that went just wide of the post. The 25-year-old Belgian is in his first year at the club and has provided three goals and three assists in the league this year. As Trossard settles into the system at Brighton, he could prove to be a key player in their upcoming seasons. I think that he could be poised for a breakout season next year as long as Brighton can hold onto their spot in the Premier League.

      <h10><b>5. United Creeps Closer to Champions League Qualification</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        With their win against Brighton, Manchester United jumps to fifth place in the Premier League, only two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and three points behind third-place Leicester City. As the season comes to a close in the next month, United’s number one goal will be securing a spot in the Champions League next season. Usually, they would need to be in the top four to qualify, but with Manchester City’s ban still being appealed, there is a chance that the fifth-place team could also qualify. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won’t want to leave anything to chance, and with a relatively easy schedule coming up, United will hope to pick up all of the points available. With three points separating third place from sixth, it is sure to be a race to the finish for these top clubs.
