    <h12><b>Final Score: Real Madrid 3-2 Inter Milan</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The two heavyweights of Group B (who were coincidentally in the bottom two positions in the group coming into this match) clashed in what felt like a final, as both of these teams’ Champions League campaigns were riding on this game. Real Madrid came out on top, giving them a better chance of securing a spot in the Round of 16. Here are my five key takeaways:

            One hallmark of Antonio Conte’s free-flowing system of play is the ability (and expectation) that his team will play out of the back whenever possible. The 3-5-2 formation that he prefers provides his 3 center backs with so much space in possession, and there are always one or two free options available when playing out of the back. However, despite how well-executed the system was, Conte cannot account for individual errors, which were prevalent as Inter attempted to play out of the back. Real Madrid won the ball high up the field numerous times in the first half, and it took until the 25th minute for Real Madrid to capitalize on one of Inter’s mistakes. Achraf Hakimi attempted to play the ball back to goalkeeper Samir Handanovic from midfield, and his pass was intercepted by Karim Benzema high upfield, who only had to round the keeper before slotting the ball home.

    <h10><b>2. Sergio Ramos Hits 100 goals For Real Madrid</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Eight minutes later, Real Madrid doubled their lead. Toni Kroos swung in a corner, and Sergio Ramos put a perfectly placed header into the back of the net. This was the captain’s 100th goal for the club, an astonishing achievement for a center back (and goes to show again how much this club relies on Ramos at both ends of the pitch). At that point, the game looked done and dusted, but Inter were quick with their response.

    <h10><b>3. Inter Fight Their Way Back Into The Match</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In the 35th minute, Inter grabbed their first goal. An astounding Nico Barella scorpion kick/backheel flick set Lautaro Martinez up for a volley that he expertly put past Thibaut Courtois, despite being closely defended by Rafa Varane. The score would remain 2-1 throughout the first portion of the second half, which Inter largely controlled. They pressed higher up the field and choked Real Madrid, not letting them out of their own half. Now it was Madrid’s turn to attempt to play out of the back, which produced some stress-inducing sequences of play, but Los Blancos were mostly successful until the 68th minute. Casemiro (whose passing was poor throughout the second half) misplaced a pass in the buildup and allowed Inter a chance at goal. Ivan Perisic (who had been largely irrelevant until this point) placed an expert finish past Courtois. At this point, it looked like Inter were in the driver seat.

    <h10><b>4. Questionable Substitutions By Zidane Pay Off</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      I was absolutely astounded when Zidane decided to pull off Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio in the 60th minute. Madrid still had the lead then, but with how much was on the line in this match, I thought that Madrid should’ve kept their best lineup on the field for longer. However, Zidane’s substitutions proved to be a masterclass, as Rodrygo and Vinicius proved to be great outlets for Real Madrid to find, as they could 1) exploit the space wide of Inter’s 3 center backs, and 2) take advantage of how tired Inter’s defense and midfield were and burn them using their pace. The two would even link up to bag Madrid the winning goal, as Vinicius broke down the left side in the 80th minute and put a low cross near the top of the box (that was most likely for Karim Benzema) that trickled through for Rodrygo, who slammed the ball into the back of the net. The two Brazilians surprised me today, but I hope this gives them both some confidence and allows them each to build off of this good performance.

    <h10><b>5. Inter Have A Tough Road Ahead In The UCL</b></h10>




        <br></br>
        <h13>
          Inter now sit on 2 points in the Champions League after 3 games have been played. There is still hope though, as group leaders Borussia Monchengladbach only have 5 points. At this point, anything can happen in group B, but Inter must win their next 3 games if they want to secure a place in the round of 16. This is entirely possible for Conte’s men, as they should have Romelu Lukaku and Milan Skriniar back for their next Champions League match on November 25th against Real Madrid, who now sit 3rd in the group, level on points with Shakhtar Donetsk (but behind on head-to-head scores).
