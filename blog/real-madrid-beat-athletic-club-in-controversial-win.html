    <h10>Real Madrid Beat Athletic Club In Controversial Win</h10>

    <h13>
      It took a controversial penalty call for Real Madrid to beat Athletic Club, in what was their toughest test since the restart. Here are my five key takeaways from the match.

            Since the restart, all of Real Madrid’s matches have taken place at 10 PM Spanish time, which has taken a toll on the team. Zidane has had to change training sessions to be later in the evening so that the players are accustomed to playing so late, and many players have voiced complaints to the Spanish FA about their situation. After becoming adjusted to playing at that time, Madrid were stunned with a 2 PM Spanish time match on Sunday. One might not think this change would be a big deal, but for players who are playing 3 matches per week, and have gotten in a routine of playing late in the evening, this change was monumental. Many Madrid players looked sluggish today, and it took about 20 minutes before Madrid really came into the match. Athletic Club’s Inaki Williams took advantage of this slow start and used his pace to get behind Madrid’s defense and test Thibaut Courtois early, and it was very lucky for Los Blancos that they didn’t concede. They will be happy to see that their next match against Alaves on Friday, will be at 10 PM Spanish time.

    <h10><b>2. Eder Militao Shines in Varane’s Absence</b></h10>
    <br></br>



          <h13>

            With Raphael Varane not included in the squad for the Bilbao match, Eder Militao took his place partnering Sergio Ramos at the center back position. Militao has had a shaky start to his career in Madrid and hasn’t impressed in the few appearances that he’s made. Today, however, he was tremendous. He did very well covering for Ramos, who had a very slow start to the match and was caught out of position multiple times. Militao used his best asset, his pace, to keep La Liga’s fastest player Inaki Williams in his pocket. As Ramos is suspended for their match against Alaves on Friday, Militao will undoubtedly be in the starting 11 again, and Zidane will be looking to him to put in another great performance.

    <h10><b>3. Inaki Williams has Trouble Finishing</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In the first half, Inaki Williams took advantage of the pace difference between himself and Real Madrid left-back Marcelo, and he broke through Madrid’s defense multiple times. Twice he made mistakes in a one-on-one with Courtois, and he was caught offside by just a step once. He could have very easily had a hattrick today if it wasn’t for poor finishing and a lack of positional awareness. This kind of performance is unusual for Williams, as he is Bilbao’s second-leading scorer with 10 goals in all competitions.

          Thursday night, in Madrid’s match against Getafe, they went into the 70th minute tied goalless and left with a 1-0 win due to a penalty. On Sunday, the same thing happened. This is their third penalty in the seven matches they have played since the restart and their second game-winning penalty. It is fair to say that Madrid is benefiting from these penalty decisions, as two of the calls were very soft (against Real Sociedad and Athletic Club) and could have easily not been called. What makes the whole situation worse is that what earned Real Madrid their penalty today (Dani Garcia stepping on Marcelo’s foot) happened at the other end only a few moments later (Sergio Ramos stepped on Raul Garcia’s foot) and it wasn’t called. There are a few reasons why Ramos’ tackle wasn’t called, as Garcia was in an offside position, and the ball wasn’t near them, but it still doesn’t sit well that Madrid so often benefits from the referees’ decisions (or lack thereof).

        </h13>
        <br></br>
        <h13>
          On a different note, Sergio Ramos now has hit a tally of 10 goals this season, the most that any defender has scored in La Liga in a single season in the 21st century. He has also scored the last 20 penalties that he has taken one of the best streaks in the world.

    <h10><b>5. Athletic Need to Look Elsewhere for European Football</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Athletic Club now sit in 8th place in La Liga, 2 points behind their rivals Real Sociedad, who have a game in hand. They have a lot of ground to make up if they want to be playing in the Europa League next season, and it’s not looking good for the Basque side. However, if they beat Sociedad in the final of the Copa del Rey, they will secure La Liga’s final Europa League spot. The only issue is, the Copa del Rey final has been delayed indefinitely, and, as there is no prospective date to play the final, it doesn’t look like it will be played before the next season starts. This presents a problem for both Sociedad and Athletic Club, as both are seeking a Europa League campaign next season, they need to set a date to play the final soon, or they will forfeit the Copa del Rey’s Europa League spot. If this happens, the 7th place team in La Liga will receive a Europa League spot, which at this time, is Real Sociedad. Athletic Club will need to win the rest of their matches (against Sevilla, Levante, Leganes, and Granada) if they want any shot at a Europa League berth.
