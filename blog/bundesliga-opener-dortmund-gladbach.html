      <h12><b>Final Score: Dortmund 3-0 Mӧnchengladbach</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Bundesliga is back! Fans are in attendance, teams look rusty after a shortened pre-season, and we’ve already got a marquee matchup between two top four teams from the previous year. Dortmund and Gladbach pretty much kept their teams intact from last season - though Hakimi is no longer at Dortmund and Gladbach had key players out - and an exciting game looked like it was in store. Unfortunately, both teams still looked in pre-season mode and Dortmund won the game comfortably. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Dortmund Aren’t At Their Best, But They Get The Job Done</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After all that has gone on in the last few months, we can forgive Dortmund for not going all out in this game. With a combination of a shortened break after the last season and players not getting the chance to get up to 100% through a full pre-season, Dortmund took a very cautious approach to this game. The rust wasn’t the only reason for this, however, as Lucian Favre likely would have set-up his team this way anyway. Dortmund knew to watch out for Gladbach’s counterattacking ability - though it lost quite a bit of threat with Plea and Thuram on the bench - so they took a more cautious approach both in their build-up and defensive pressing. On offense, Dortmund tried to keep tight by passing among the centerbacks while waiting for space to open up. This did lead to long stretches without chances being created, but it did work in protecting against counterattacks from Gladbach. On defense, Dortmund sat deep and hardly pressed at all (28.77 passes per defensive action in the opposition half according to understat.com) which kept Gladbach from exploiting spaces in behind the Dortmund defense. It was a good gameplan that both eprotected against opposition strengths and kept the players from going all out before they were ready.

      <h10><b>2. Gladbach Look Toothless Without Plea And Thuram</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Though they did make appearances off the bench late in the game, Gladbach’s dynamic front two of Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram were sorely missed against Dortmund. The two combined for 38 goal contributions in the league last season, and without them Gladbach never really looked like a threat to score. When Dortmund were forced to come forward and play into Gladbach’s hands - which admittedly wasn’t very often - Marco Rose’s didn’t have the players needed to take advantage of the few counterattacking opportunities they had. When both forwards were subbed on after Dortmund went up 2-0, Gladbach could not create enough chances for Plea and Thuram to make an impact off the bench. Gladbach should be fine this season once everyone is back in the starting XI, but they’ll need to get up to speed quick if they want to qualify for the Champions League again.

      <h10><b>3. Gio Reyna Shows He Can Make An Impact This Season</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        17 year olds really shouldn’t be counted on to make an impact at a top level club, but the best ones always find a way to show why they can be. Today, two 17 year olds were in the starting lineup for Dortmund - England’s Jude Bellingham and the USA’s Giovanni Reyna. Bellingham had a solid debut (even picking up an assist for Reyna’s goal), and he should get plenty of opportunities in a Dortmund midfield with limited options, but Reyna really starred today. Playing mainly on the left, Reyna showed a lot of promise with some driving runs - including one in which he drew a penalty - and combining well in a fluid front three with Sancho and Haaland. Dortmund don’t exactly need another talented attacker, with both Reus and Brandt available alongside Sancho and Haaland, but Reyna showed today that he can be counted on to perform well if needed despite his young age.

      <h10><b>4. Emre Can Is A Good Replacement For Piszczek At Right Centerback</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Despite playing well last season, with Piszczek finishing last season at 34 years old, a replacement was needed. It was a key position to be filled, as his ability to play at centerback or rightback allowed Dortmund to switch between a 3 and 4 at the back depending on how high up the field Hakimi was playing at any given point in the game.. This versatility was probably the key attribute to look for in his replacement, and the solution came out of who Dortmund signed to replace Hakimi. Thomas Meunier was signed on a free transfer from PSG, and his ability to play as either a wingback or a fullback allowed Lucian Favre to fill Piszczek’s spot with someone who was not as comfortable in a fullback role. Defensive midfielder Emre Can - who has some experience playing as a centerback - filled the spot, but instead of switching between centerback and rightback, Can would push up into midfield as Meunier dropped back into defense. His ball carrying abilities allowed him to drive up the field and provide support to Bellingham and Witsel in midfield and turn Dortmund’s shape from a 3-4-3 to more of a 4-3-3 which was much more effective at breaking down Gladbach’s tight defense. This is definitely something to watch out for the rest of the season, both to see how this role evolves with Can and how opponents might be able to exploit it.

      <h10><b>5. Reduced Capacity Might Be Even Stranger Than No Fans</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Maybe it’s just that I’ve gotten used to seeing games with no fans in attendance, especially in the Bundesliga, but I thought the limited capacity (which is supposedly around 9,000 people) felt even stranger than when we had no fans. The atmosphere still wasn’t there so it all felt a bit eerie and at times funny. For example, there was one passage of play in the first half where both teams were settled in and Gladbach was patiently passing around the back and all I could hear were maybe 3-4 people whistling from somewhere in the stadium. That was as much atmosphere as I could get from some of the absolute best fans in the world. I feel like at that point, with all that’s going on with the pandemic, is it really worth the gate money from 9,000 people to have fans in attendance? I don’t know. I’m sure it will feel less weird as we get into the season just like when we started without fans last May. But watching the Bundesliga this season with fans and not getting the atmosphere we usually do is going to be even weirder for me than empty stadiums were.
