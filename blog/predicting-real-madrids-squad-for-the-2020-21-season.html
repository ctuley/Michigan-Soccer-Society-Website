    <h13>
      Due to COVID-19, the La Liga season and the Champions League campaign had to be pushed back by a few months, as did the summer transfer window. And you know what that means: more time to speculate who each club will sign! As always Real Madrid is at the forefront of the transfer discussions, as every player that had a good season is usually linked with them. I’m here to help you wade through all of those transfer rumors, and sort out which ones are valid and which are rubbish, and provide you with my thoughts on what Los Blancos’ squad will look like heading into the 2020-2021 season.

<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Thibaut Courtois (Keep)</b></u> Madrid’s undisputed starter, and the best goalkeeper in La Liga in the 19/20 season, having the most clean sheets (15) and fewest goals conceded (18) in the league. Don’t expect the big Belgian to leave anytime soon.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Alphonse Areola (Return to PSG)</b></u> The World Cup winner hasn’t impressed at the Bernabeu, and he will be expected to return to Paris Saint Germain at the end of the season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Andriy Lunin (Return from loan)</b></u> The Ukrainian shot-stopper didn’t make a single start for Real Valladolid in La Liga, and was loaned to La Liga Smartbank side Real Oviedo in January, where he had 4 clean sheets in 14 matches. Expect Lunin to be Real Madrid’s backup for the 20/21 season in La Liga and Champions League,though he should start Copa del Rey matches
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Diego Altube (Real Madrid Castilla)</b></u> Altube has been impressive for Real Madrid’s youth team, and I expect him to continue to play for Castilla next season. I would love to see him training with the first team consistently, and be on the bench for smaller La Liga matches next year. Altube has bunches of potential, and he needs first team experience to prosper.

<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Sergio Ramos (Keep)</b></u> How can they let him go? Madrid’s best player in the 19/20 season, and he has a serious shout for La Liga Player of the Year. He has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season (Madrid’s second highest scorer) and has captained the best defense in La Liga (21 goals conceded in 32 matches). I expect the Madrid board to, in typical Real Madrid fashion, offer Ramos 1 year contracts at the end of every season until he retires.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Rafael Varane (Keep)</b></u> This has been Rafa’s best season in a white shirt. He has accumulated 28 league appearances (keeping 13 clean sheets), and partnered Sergio Ramos to form the best center back duo in the world. It would take a monumental sum to force Los Blancos to part ways with the future of their back line.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Carvajal (Keep)</b></u> Dani has started 84% of Madrid’s La Liga matches, and at 28 years old, he has finally hit his peak. This season he has notched up 1 goal and 7 assists in all competitions, and, as he links up so well with the current squad, it seems far fetched that the Castilla graduate will leave the Bernabeu this summer.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Mendy (Keep)</b></u> Madrid’s best signing of the 2019 summer transfer window, Ferland Mendy has been a rock at the back, and seems to be the perfect heir to Marcelo. While not as offensively-minded, his defensive capabilities far exceed those of the Brazilian, something that has benefited Los Blancos greatly this season. Expect him to start most La Liga matches next season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Marcelo (Keep)</b></u> Oh, Marcelo. How the mighty have fallen. Two years ago, Marcelo was the best left back in the world, and now he wouldn’t crack the top ten. Before the Covid-19 break, Marcelo’s performances were lethargic, and completely unlike his past self. Since the break has ended, Marcelo seems revitalized, and he has shown shades of his past self. I expect him to compete with Ferland Mendy for the starting left-back spot next season, and start most of Madrid’s big matches, as Zidane favors experience in key matches. Sadly, I do expect this to be the 32 year old’s last season with Real Madrid, as his contract expires in 2022, and Madrid will not want to let him leave for free that summer.
    </h13>
    <img src="../blog-img/predicting-real-madrids-squad-for-the-2020-21-season/predicting-real-madrids-squad-for-the-2020-21-season-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Eder Militao (Keep)</b></u> This is a controversial pick, as many people are calling for Militao to be sold, and for Madrid to bring in RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano. I, however, would like to see Militao stay for another season, as I think he has a lot of potential, and is still settling in at Real Madrid. I believe that he deserves another chance, and I think Zidane will want to keep him for one more year before calling this transfer a bust.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Javi Hernandez (Loan)</b></u> I expect the Castilla man to leave on loan next season, hopefully to a low-level or mid-tier La Liga team. This will give him the experience he needs to return to Madrid and fight for a starting position in the future. I will be greatly disappointed if he plays for Castilla next season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Nacho (Keep)</u></b> This one is strange for me. Nacho is an excellent squad player, and he is a huge asset to Real Madrid because he can play any position in the back line. I can see Zidane wanting to keep him for squad depth, but I can also see him leave to seek consistent first team football, I would like to see him stay, but as he has only made 8 appearances this season, I wouldn’t blame him if he chose to leave.
    </h13>

          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Achraf Hakimi</u></b>(Sell to Inter Milan) I couldn’t believe it when I saw the news reports: Achraf Hakimi was in Milan ahead of a medical for Inter. Hakimi is set to be one of the best full backs in the world, and Real Madrid have him for free. Next season he could compete with Carvajal for the right back position, and both players would be better off for it. Eventually, Hakimi would overtake Carvajal, and would be our starting right back for many years. Sadly, it appears this dream will never come to fruition. I can’t imagine that Real Madrid wouldn’t sell him if they didn’t have to, and Zidane did mention that the club was having financial troubles in his last interview (wild times, right?). It is very disappointing for Real Madrid to miss out on such a promising player, and I hope a buy-back clause is put into his contract.
          </h13>
          <br></br>

          <h13>
            <b><u>Alvaro Odriozola (Loan)</u></b> Odriozola hasn’t done much in the past few years, he’s a liability in defense, and nonexistent in attack. This is why Zidane loaned him to Bayern Munich: to see if Odriozola could fit into a different system, or shine under different coaching. So far, Odriozola’s loan has been unimpressive, making only 3 Bundesliga appearances for the Bavarians. Even though he will return from loan this summer, I expect Zidane to send him out again, in hope that he will increase his market value (to sell him later on), or rediscover the form he had at Real Sociedad.

    </div>

    <h13>
      <b><u>Sergio Reguilon (Loan)</u></b> Reguilon has been awesome this season at Sevilla, he fits Julen Lopetegui’s style of play perfectly. I would love for him to rejoin Los Blancos after his loan ends this summer, but due to the abundance of left backs in the Madrid squad (Mendy, Marcelo) I think Zidane will find him another loan for next season, probably back to Sevilla. After that, I hope he returns to Madrid, a competition for the starting left back spot between Reguilon and Mendy will certainly be a sight to behold.

<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Casemiro (Keep)</b></u> One of Madrid’s most important players this season, he’s started 29 of our 32 league matches. He’s the team’s only holding midfielder, which only emphasizes how much Real Madrid needs him. The Brazilian has even scored 5 goals and assisted 4 times in all competitions. Casemiro is only 28 years old, so expect him to continue to wear white for the next few years.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Toni Kroos (Keep)</b></u> Another one of Madrid’s key players from this year, Kroos has been at his very best this season. He sets the tempo of every match he plays, completely controlling the game. Kroos is usually not one to score a game winner, or make a 50 sprint through an opponent’s defense, but he is the one who controls the game from behind the scenes, and his performances impact how Madrid plays more than any other. Aside from Sergio Ramos, there is no player I fear losing more than the German.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Fede Valverde (Keep)</b></u> The young Uruguayan has broken into the Real Madrid first team in style this season. The fact that he has displaced Ballon d’or winner Luka Modric in the starting lineup just goes to show how good he really is. Fede has incredible work rates, moving all over the field, and his creativity in the final third is criminally underrated, having 2 goals and 5 assists in 27 La Liga appearances. I expect Fede to join Casemiro and Kroos in our starting midfield 3 next season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Luka Modric (Keep)</b></u> Even though Luka has been replaced in the starting eleven by Fede Valverde, that hasn’t stopped him from putting in great performances off the bench. Modric seems to have accepted his smaller role at the club, and seems willing to remain even though he will receive less time on the pitch. Even with less time on the field, Luka has racked up some fine numbers for Los Blancos, having scored 5 goals and assisting 6 in 34 appearances this season. However, Luka will be 35 in September, and even though Zidane favors experience in his squad, I do believe this will be Luka’s last season with Madrid, as his contract does expire next summer. I would love to see him retire in the white shirt, but I don’t know how keen the board will be to renew the contract of a 35 year old over that of someone much younger.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>James Rodriguez</b></u> (Sell to Atletico Madrid, Napoli, Everton) It pains me to see James like this, struggling so much. He was so good in his first 3 seasons in Madrid, and his loan spell in Munich wasn’t bad. When James is playing well, and happy about his play, he is truly amazing to watch. In this past season, when James has played, his performances have been poor and his attitude seems down. It is sad to see a player who was once so energetic and explosive reduced to one who misplaces passes and is afraid to shoot. It is my hope that James leaves this summer, and finds his form once again, because I want to see the player who amazed us all at the 2014 World Cup once again.
    </h13>
    <img src="../blog-img/predicting-real-madrids-squad-for-the-2020-21-season/predicting-real-madrids-squad-for-the-2020-21-season-5.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Isco (Keep)</b></u> This season has been a strange one for Isco. He has completed a full match once this season, and has been used as a super sub about a third of the time. This must be difficult for Isco, as a player of his calibre deserves to be playing all match, every match. When he plays, the Spaniard is wildly inconsistent, sometimes putting in a Man of the Match worthy performance, and other times you can’t even tell he’s there. It feels like Zidane doesn’t know how or where to use Isco, and this has hindered his playing time and performances. The lack of rumors linking Isco to other teams has been strange as well, but this can be explained by the attention his typical suitors Manchester City are giving their Champions League ban appeal, as they are not too focused on incoming transfers. As no one is interested in signing Isco, I expect him to stay.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Eduardo Camavinga (Signed from Rennes)</b></u> Yes, I do expect Real Madrid to get their biggest target in this transfer window, despite Rennes director Florian Maurice saying they wouldn’t sell him. I think it will take a lot of money (between 70-80 million euros) to get Rennes to agree to let the Frenchman leave, but as we all know, Madrid has a lot of money. I believe that Camavinga will be the heir to Casemiro, and he should fit right in to Zidane’s style of play, as he will sit in front of the back four and disrupt opposition runs at the back line. There have been talks that if Madrid did sign Camavinga, they would loan him back to Rennes for the next season. I would not be opposed to this, as more first team experience and minutes can’t hurt, but I would like Camavinga to get acquainted with the squad as soon as possible if we signed him, even if that does mean sitting on the bench for much of his first season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Martin Odegaard (Stay on loan)</b></u> The Norweigan has been fantastic this La Liga campaign for Real Sociedad, scoring 4 goals and assisting 5. He has fit La Real’s system perfectly, and his market value has skyrocketed (50 million euros). It seems like a no-brainer that Real Madrid will cut his loan a year short, and inject his talent into their squad. However, Odegaard is an attacking midfielder, a position that Zidane seems to be against (see Isco, James Rodriguez), as he favors 2 box-to-box midfielders and a holding midfielder in his 4-3-3 system. Therefore, I believe that Odegaard will remain at Real Sociedad for the next season, and be sold by Madrid next summer.
    </h13>


          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Dani Ceballos (Sell)</b></u> Ceballos’ loan spell at Arsenal hasn’t been a complete failure, he has 2 assists in 18 appearances. It feels as though this loan spell was not to give Ceballos more experience in a top league, but to increase Dani’s market value, as Zidane has made it very clear he has no future in Madrid. It’s sad to see a player who once had so much potential reduced to a benchwarmer at Arsenal, and I hope that wherever Dani ends up he will rediscover the form he had at Real Betis.
          </h13>

        <div class="card-articles">
          <h13>
            <b><u>Karim Benzema (Keep)</b></u> Another one of Madrid’s best players this season, Benzema has performed at new levels this year. He is Madrid’s highest scorer with 22 goals in all competitions, and the second highest scorer in La Liga. Even though the Frenchman is now 32, Real Madrid have shown no signs of wanting to get rid of him, a testament to all he has done in the white shirt.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Eden Hazard (Keep)</b></u> What a shame it is that Hazard has not been healthy for the entirety of this season, I’d love to see what numbers the Belgian can put up when he is fully fit and consistently in the starting 11. Due to multiple injuries he has only made 19 appearances this season, scoring one goal and assisting 7. Hopefully he stays injury-free next season, and can light up La Liga like he did in London for some many years.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Vinicius Jr. (Keep)</b></u> Vinicius has drastically improved this season, though his stats may not show it. His lightning-fast dribbles are now more direct and goal-oriented, and his passing and finishing have both improved, though both need work. Especially after the Covid-19 break, Vinicius has shown why Real Madrid paid 45 million euros for him, bagging a goal and an assist in 5 matches, and was worthy of a Man of the Match award in two matches. I hope that Brazilian is worked into the starting 11 more next season, as his explosiveness and creativity are essential to Madrid’s goal-scoring efforts.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Marco Asensio (Keep)</b></u> I cannot possibly explain the joy I felt seeing Asensio return to the pitch after missing most of the season due to a torn ACL. He is such a great player, he is lightning fast and has one of the best left feet in the game. Apparently, in training he has been working at the right wing role, which has been up for grabs since Gareth Bale had his falling-out with Zidane. I have no doubt Marco will stay in Madrid, and I hope he is a starter in the 2020-2021 campaign.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            <b><u>Gareth Bale (Sell)</b></u> No player ever has disappointed me as much as Gareth Bale. In his first few seasons in Madrid, he was unplayable, and filled the right wing position in the fearsome BBC trident. Now, Gareth is a shadow of his former self, only scoring 3 goals in 20 appearances this season. It doesn’t help that he doesn’t have the backing of Zidane, or his teammates. It feels like Gareth has given up on Real Madrid, and is willing to sit the bench and ride out his contract. I hope that Madrid finds a club who is willing to give him a chance, and he can show everyone why he was once the most expensive player in the world.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h13>
      <b><u>Lucas Vazquez (Keep)</b></u> Lucas is a great squad player. When you need a winger, he’s there. When you need a right back, or an attacking midfielder, he’s there. Lucas is a player who’s content with sitting on the bench and playing the ‘substitute’ role, and every club needs one or two players like this (Nacho is another like this for Real Madrid). Lucas has great chemistry with the rest of the squad, and Zidane seems to like him, so I don’t see any reason for Madrid to sell him.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Brahim Diaz (Loan)</b></u> Ever since Brahim joined Los Blancos in the winter of 2019, he’s been pressed for minutes in the Spanish capital, the exact reason he left Manchester City. I think it would be best for Brahim to get a loan out to a big club who are willing to give him a starting position (Borussia Dortmund, anyone?). It would be a win-win-win situation, as Brahim would get more playing time, Madrid would get a more experienced player once Brahim returns, and whatever club he is loaned to would receive an exceptional player hungry for minutes.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Rodrygo (Keep)</b></u> Rodrygo would be my choice for Madrid’s breakout star of the season. He’s their third leading scorer (7), despite only making 24 appearances in all competitions. I believe that Rodrygo will battle Asensio for the starting right wing spot next season, and this competition will only make the young Brazilian a better player.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Takefusa Kubo (Loan)</b></u> Kubo’s loan at Mallorca has gone very well, and while I don’t expect him to be in Madrid next season, I think he will be loaned out to a team that has European football (probably Real Sociedad). I don’t believe there is any chance Real Madrid sells him, and the board knows that bringing him in to sit on the bench will stunt his growth, so I would expect to see Kubo wearing a different shirt next season, preparing for a return to Madrid in the future.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Mariano Diaz (Sell)</b></u> It was never smart to buy him back in the summer of 2018. This was a panic-buy, as a result of Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure. Mariano was then given the number 7 shirt, and impossible expectations to live up to. We all knew he would never be the next Ronaldo, or anything close to him. Mariano was destined to not succeed in Madrid. I feel sorry for him, he left Madrid searching for glory, and when he found it, Madrid brought him back, and gave him hope that he could be great there. Then, they didn’t even put him on the bench in most matches. I would sell Mariano as a service to him, so that he can build a fine career elsewhere.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      <b><u>Luka Jovic (Keep)</b></u> Jovic was great in Frankfurt, and everyone believed that his tremendous performances would carry over to Real Madrid. Sadly, we were all mistaken. Luka has played 15 La Liga matches (only starting 3) and has scored 3 goals. Not a good tally for a striker worth 60 million euros. I believe that this season was necessary for Jovic to settle in Madrid, and I think he deserves another chance. For this reason I would utilize him as a backup striker next season. If his form continues, expect him to be shipped off in the winter transfer window.

      Since Kepa’s infamous refusal to be substituted in the EFL Cup, Chelsea supporters and Lampard have turned on the world’s most expensive keeper. In recent games Lampard has started the 38-year-old Willy Caballero over Kepa. Clearly Caballero is not in the long term plans for Lampard trying to build a young team and many reports have linked Ajax’s Andre Onana to the Bridge.
