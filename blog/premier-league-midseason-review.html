        What a wild Premier League season it has been so far. We have had huge upsets, crazy scheduling issues, numerous postponed games, and an exciting title race that could come down to the final few weeks. There has been plenty to talk about this season, but let’s run through some standout categories (for better and worse):

      <h10><b>Player Of The Season: Jack Grealish (FWL/AMC - Aston Villa)</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The best part about there not being a standout team in the league this season is that it does not feel like there is some obligation to give one of their players the “Player Of Ther Year” title. As a result, we can give our midseason POTS award to a player from outside the top six: Jack Grealish. The attacking midfielder has been phenomenal this season for Aston Villa. He is creating at Kevin De Bruyne levels, while also shouldering most of the ball progression burden on his team. He ranks top 5 in non-penalty xG+A and ranks first in shot-creating actions, progressive actions, and penalty box entries. De Bruyne is a close second, but I think you have to give this title to Jack Grealish simply because he is driving his whole team forward himself.

    <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
      <br></br>
      <h10><b>Signing Of The Season: Ruben Dias (CB - Manchester City)</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The fee of €68 million seemed hefty at the time for a player of his standing, but in the absence of Aymeric Laporte, Dias has been the rock of Manchester City’s league-best defense. Centerback was a position of need for Manchester City this summer, both because of injury troubles and a disastrous campaign in 2019-20. Ruben Dias’s positioning and ball-playing ability have made him a perfect fit for Pep Guardiola’s system, and he has been not just the best signing of the season, but one of the best players of the season.

      <h10><b>Worst Signing Of The Season: Thomas Partey (MC - Arsenal)</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In fairness, Thomas Partey is a very good player, and will likely be very good for Arsenal in the future. However, at this point in the season, I think Partey has been the worst signing of the season. For one thing, €50 million was way too much for a player who has only given his team 365 league minutes so far, especially when Arsenal did not even have enough money to pay their mascot’s salary. On top of that, Partey is not really a player Arsenal needed. His player profile is very similar to that of a player they already have: Dani Ceballos. It has also become very clear that what Arsenal needed to bring in was a creative midfielder (they currently create chances at a mid-table level). Thomas Partey is a very good player, but he was a bad signing for Arsenal, and given how little he has played and the transfer fee he is the worst signing of the Premier League season so far.

      <h10><b>Manager Of The Season: Brendan Rodgers (Leicester City)</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        This was a tough one with no really outstanding team, and some honorable mentions are Dean Smith at Aston Villa, Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United. However, I am giving this award to Brendan Rodgers for the job he has done with Leicester City this season. Rodgers has had to deal with key player departures, injuries, and a Europa League campaign and has gotten his team to third place at the halfway mark, just two points out of first. Under Rodgers, Leicester look dangerous. Thanks to their depth and versatility, they can win in multiple ways and they can beat anyone on their day. If they can get healthy, they could stay in the title race all the way to the end.

      <h10><b>Team Of The Season:</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        GK: Emiliano Martinez
        <br></br>
        DF: Andy Robertson, Ruben Dias, Wesley Fofana, Joao Cancelo
        <br></br>
        MID: N’Golo Kante, Bruno Fernandes, Kevin De Bruyne
        <br></br>
        FW: Jack Grealish, Son Heung-min, Harry Kane
      </h13>
      <img src="../blog-img/premier-league-midseason-review/premier-league-midseason-review-7.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%">
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I explained a couple of these players above, and a few more are consensus picks (like Bruno or De Bruyne), so I’ll give a quick explanation for a couple that I do not think a lot of people would choose. Wesley Fofana has been a rock at the back for Leicester City this season, and he has done an excellent job coming in for the injured Caglar Soyuncu despite being just 20 years old. He is an active defender and has complemented it with good ball progression. N’Golo Kante is a player I wanted to include partly because I wanted a more defensive-minded midfielder, but also because he has been critical in Chelsea’s best stretches this season. He has been given a tough job of covering for two more attack-minded players, and he has risen to the occasion ranking near the top of the league in pressures and tackles+interceptions per 90. Finally, Emiliano Martinez has been stellar for Aston Villa this season. He is saving about a third of a goal per 90 more than expected by Statsbomb’s post-shot xG metric, which ranks near the top in Europe’s top 5 leagues and he is level with Atletico Madrid’s Jan Oblak (considered by many to be the top goalkeeper in the world).
      </h13>

      <p5 style="float:right;"><i>source: Getty Images</i></p5>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It should be an exciting finish to this Premier League season, and it will be interesting to see how my opinions on these categories change based on how teams and players do down the stretch.
