      Bayern Münich win a close one with title implications. Here are the five takeaways from today's game.

    <h10><b>1. A Match Light On Chances, But High On Tension</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      There’s no doubt, this match was a title decider. With Dortmund coming into the game four points behind with seven games to go, it was a must-win for the home side. Bayern came into the match on a 13 match unbeaten run - and just one draw to third-place RB Leipzig - and in their current form looked unlikely to drop many points the rest of the way. With Dortmund not wanting a repeat of the 4-0 drubbing in the reverse fixture, and Bayern really only needing a draw to keep Dortmund at a safe distance, both teams came out conservatively. Dortmund tried to stay compact and deeper than usual - their passes per defensive action was 18.44 (understat.com) - and while Bayern pressed plenty, in possession they tended to play safer passes and slowly build their way up the field. Bayern’s fullbacks, Pavard and Davies, tended to stay a bit deeper to protect against the counter-attacking threat of Dortmund, and this paid off a number of times throughout the match. Both teams struggled to find clear-cut chances, and as a result only one shot had an xG value over 0.1 - Gnabry in the 18’ with an xG of 0.36 (understat.com). But, despite the lack of good goal scoring opportunities, the match was still rife with tension worthy of a match between the top two teams in the league. It’s something I expected from the derby matches I’ve covered over the last couple of weeks, but I guess the third time’s the charm. <i>(Mitchel Green)</i>

    <h10><b>2. A Quiet Night From The Two Star Strikers</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Despite the disappointing final score for the mid-table team, Union Berlin should be far from ashamed from their performance on Sunday. While Bayern was able to conjure up a total of 13 shots, with 3 being on target, a huge majority of these opportunities were half-chances at best. The frustration from players like Gnabry, Müller, and Goretzka was apparent as they had shot after shot blocked by the in-form Berlin defense.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While Bayern did control the midfield throughout the match, they struggled to break through the final third consistently. The late substitution of Kingsley Coman for Goretzka was able to spur some late creativity and pace, but Bayern’s all-star offense was still unable to create many decent chances from open play. <i>(Mitchel Green)</i>

    <h10><b>3. Kimmich Brilliance Or Burki Error?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In a tight match like this one, there was always going to be one defining moment that would swing it in either direction. It occurred right before halftime, as Bayern midfielder Joshua Kimmich received the ball a few yards outside of the box, spotted Roman Bürki off his line, and lobbed it just over the goalkeeper’s outstretched hand to put it in the back of the net. It was as unexpected for everyone else as it seemed to be for Bürki. He got a hand to it but seemed to freeze and right as the shot was taken, seemingly baffled by Kimmich actually taking the shot. People have criticized Bürki for how he handled this shot, but that shouldn’t take away from the fact that this was a truly marvelous goal from Kimmich. During the match, Fox Sports reported the xG of the goal to be 0.06. A bit of luck was probably involved, but it took immense vision from Kimmich to spot Bürki off his line, and a deft touch to put it just over the goalkeeper’s hand. It was fitting that this extremely tight title match would be decided by a moment of individual brilliance. <i>(Mitchel Green)</i>

            It’s easy to be a Bayern Munich fan. Over the past 20 years, Bayern has failed to win the Bundesliga 6 times with Dortmund winning 3 of them. After today’s close win, FiveThirtyEight gives the German juggernauts a 98% chance to throw beer at one another yet again. Maybe, we’ll see what the social distancing guidelines say about partying. Only six games remain in the season and two of the matches will be somewhat competitive with Bayern away at Leverkusen June 6th and hosting Monchengladbach June 13th. With a Dortmund win today, BVB would have been one point out of first which would have made things interesting. Instead, a 7 point gap exists. Unfortunately for other German clubs, it’s hard to see Bayern falling off in years to come with young rising stars like Alphonso Davies and Gnabry. Not to mention David Alaba, Kingsley Coman, Joshua Kimmich, and Goerztka who are all under the age of 27. Bayern were already favorites to win the Champions League before the pandemic but if they can seal the Leroy Sane deal, it’s hard to see anyone who could stop them. <i>(Grant Ho)</i>

    <h10><b>5. Would the Yellow Wall Have Rallied Dortmund?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In a super competitive match, it’s reasonable to ask if Dortmund’s famous Yellow Wall would have propelled BVB to a victory. The Dortmund stadium crew made a valiant effort to create fan noise, but it’s not the same. FiveThirtyEight has adjusted its win probability models reducing the impact of home-field by 10%. One study shows that “soccer has the best home-field advantage of any mainstream sport. The home team wins 49% of the time, and the away team only wins 29% of the time. Draws make up the other 22%.” Bayern is clearly a superior team, but with Haaland’s magic and the huge implications of the game, skills and tactics are sometimes a wash. It’s the fans that give the team a boost of energy and hope. Haaland probably would not have left the game with the injury and the referee may have been more likely to side with Dortmund on calls. We’ve seen how home teams with crowds have rallied in the past and it’s hard to avoid thinking what if… <i>(Grant Ho)</i>
