      <h13>
        Diego Simeone’s men beat Real Betis courtesy of a Diego Costa goal, giving them a guaranteed Champions League spot next season. Here are five key takeaways:

      <h10><b>1. Two VAR Decisions Go Against Atletico Madrid</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Atletico Madrid had two goals overturned in the first half, both that easily could have stood. The first was a volley by Angel Corre in the 22nd minute that was rightly overruled due to a handball on the assist from Marcos Llorente. The second overturned goal came in the 34th minute, as Alvaro Morata broke through the Betis back line and chipped keeper Dani Fernandez. Morata was deemed offside on the pass that set him through on goal, and the call was incredibly close. VAR has been said to favor the attacker in situations where the referee cannot tell if a player is onside or not, and that did not happen today. If Atletico had not won the match, they would be justified to feel hard done by the referees.

      <h10><b>2. Red Card To Mario Hermoso Changes The Game</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        In the 57th minute, Atletico center back Mario Hermoso tackled Betis striker Loren from behind (without getting the ball), and he was immediately red carded. This changed the course of the game, as Diego Simeone had to use his final substitution to bring on a replacement center back in Felipe Augusto. Once they were down to 10 men, Atletico sat in their own half more, and absorbed Betis’ pressure, allowing them to hold the ball for long spells. Atletico did what they do best, and they defended magnificently, and eventually got the ball up the field to win a free kick, which earned them the game-winning goal. One could almost say that the red card for Hermoso benefitted Atletico Madrid, as it allowed them to play in a way that suited their style.

      <h10><b>4. Betis Are In Need Of New Management, Will Thrive Under Pellegrini</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        After Rubi was sacked last month, Real Betis fans were left wondering who would manage their team next season. Interim manager and sporting director Alexis Trujillo was placed in charge of the team for the remainder of the season, and he has failed to rejuvenate this team (2-3-1 as manager). Recently it was announced that former Real Madrid and Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini will take over Betis next season, and that will excite all Betis fans. Pellegrini won the Premier League in 2014 with Manchester City, but it is his accomplishments with Spanish side Malaga that will really give Betis fans hope. In his first full season with Malaga, he guided them to 4th place in La Liga, and a Champions League spot. In his next season, he took Malaga to the Champions League quarter finals, a momentous feat for a team like Malaga. With talents in this Betis squad like Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales, and Diego Lainez, Pellegrini should be able to turn this team into a squad that will compete for a Europa League place in La Liga next season.

      <h10><b>5. Joaquin Ties La Liga Appearance Record</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Joaquin began his career in 1999, playing for Real Betis B. He is now 38 years old (turning 39 later this month), and hasn’t shown any sign that he wants to hang up his boots. Against Atletico on Saturday night, he tied Raul’s La Liga appearance record of 550 matches. As Betis still have two matches left to play this season (and he will be playing next season), it can be assumed that Jaoquin will set a new record for appearances, and I don’t believe that anyone will ever come close to the Spaniard’s tally.
