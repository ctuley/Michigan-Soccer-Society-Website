      <h12><b>Final Score: Manchester City 2 - 5 Leicester City</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Manchester City vs Leicester City, in recent history, has had a knack of producing classics. I instantly remember the Robert Huth brace in Leicester’s dream season while Man City fans will allude to Kevn De Bruyne’s left-footed ping in the centurion season and of course, the infamous ‘Vinny No Shoot’ in 2019. While both teams would have hoped to keep their 100% records in the Premier League intact, both managers would also have been aware that this game would not be straightforward. Little did they know, it would end up being a roller-coaster ride of epic proportions.

      <h10><b>1. Simple Football</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The beautiful game has never been subject to as much tactical and statistical analysis as it is today. Master tacticians like Marcelo Bielsa, Antonio Conte and of course, Pep Guardiola are widely revered, and correctly so. This game, however, was an indictment of how far a team can go if they get the basics right. Leicester were without four of their five best players last night, and have been for sometime. No Ben Chilwell, No Ricardo Pereia, No Wilfred Ndidi and No James Maddison. Add to that a barely fit Johnny Evans and you realise that Brendan Rodgers really had very few options. Yet, they came away with the victory. How? Simple Football. The three center-backs, including a resurgent Daniel Amartey, who is finally back to playing football, two years to the day he suffered his horrific injury, along with the wing-backs and central midfielders were the epitome of discipline. Nevertheless, they hit City where it hurts the most, on the counter. Man City have a soft center, and akin to Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez at Wolves, Harvey Barnes and Jamie Vardy were licking their fingers when they saw City’s highline couple with an inexperienced and rash defense. Yes, there is honour in sticking to your philosophy and not adapting your game to any opposition, but surely Pep can’t fall for the same trick time after time.

      <h10><b>2. Jamie Vardy Having A Party</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        It’s been going on since 2015, and it feels like it’ll never end, although everyone seems adamant that Vardy is past it. ‘He’s got to slow down eventually’, they say. Nonsense. Jamie Vardy is shutting down his critics week in, week out and if he hadn’t already cemented his status as Premier League Legend, last night was another reason why he should not be considered anything less. The Golden Boot winner hit his second hat-trick against the Blue half of Manchester, an absolute peach of a finish sandwiched by two unstoppable penalties. It wasn’t just the goal though. Leicester’s No. 9 pestered the City defense throughout the game, even while nursing what looked like a groin pull 60 minutes into the game. As the game demands higher and higher levels of fitness and with players peaking and rapidly declining by their early 30s, Jamie Vardy is a rare and frankly ridiculous breed. Having defenders on strings at the age of 33, with a pre-match diet comprised of Red Bull and Chips, this man can do it all. Oh, and he discovered a new type of shot today. Gary Neville and his Leicester teammates might have coined it the ‘Johan Dink’, but I don’t think anyone can take it away from this man. Plus, the ‘Jamie Dink’ does have a nice ring to it.

      <h10><b>3. Is It Already Panic Time For Pep And The Cityzens?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Probably not… but Pep and his team have to up their game. Other than that Mahrez beauty, there were no other positives from the game. Sterling looked rusty, Mahrez’s decision making was poor, Delap found it difficult to cope with the pace of the game, De Bruyne’s influence faded as the clock ticked on and things completely fell apart once Fernandinho was subbed off… and I haven’t even gotten to the defense yet. Pep has been criticized for his team selection before, and last night only justified those critics. Walker might still be a valuable asset going forward, but there is no reason why he should be starting over Joao Cancelo. Mendy has not kicked on as many would have hoped, and his only telling contribution was made in his own penalty box. This summer had to be a big one for City if they wanted to close the gap on Liverpool, but their business so far leaves a lot to be desired. Left back still an issue as we head into the final week of the transfer window, City fans need to pray that rumoured £65 Million move for Ruben Dias and the return of Aymeric Laporte will lead to an up-turn in their fortunes, but if injuries persist, the club could be in for a long season.

      <h10><b>4. We Really Need To Talk About Penalties</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        21 penalties in 26 league games is not a joke. Practically every game this weekend has been decided on penalties and more specifically, on the new handball rule. You’ve seen it all over social media by now. Zero consistency in decision making and even less common sense in the interpretation of the rule. Yes, even the referees hands are tied, but it is really hard to justify what is going on in football at the moment. Turning our attention back to this game, however, all three penalties were clear cut. No VAR needed. How three different defenders have made the same, schoolboy mistake in the same game is beyond me, and I am certain will baffle Guardiola as well. Reckless, Desperate and Damning. Man City might just have gotten something out of this game if these calamities had not occured, but that would have been papering over the cracks. Penalties or no penalties, Leicester were the better team.

      <h10><b>5. Bonkers</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        I thought I would take the time to just list out some of the incredible statistics this game gave us and some of them are absolutely ridiculous:
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • James Maddison scored his first goal since New Year’s day 2020… and what a goal it was.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • This was the first time a Pep Guardiola side has conceded five goals at home.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • This Man City side had conceded only one goal at home in their last seven games prior to today. They conceded five &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; in this game itself.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • Jaime Vardy becomes the first player to score a hat-trick away to City since Michael Owen, 18 years ago.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • Jamie Vardy and Lionel Messi are the only players to have scored hat-tricks against Pep’s Man City, with the former &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; netting his second treble last night, the first coming in 2016.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • Jamie Vardy is now the highest scorer against Pep’s Man City (with Lionel Messi - yes, the same Messi who doesn’t &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; even play in the same country as Man City and their oppositions - sitting at third place on this list) with 7 goals against &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; them.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • Jamie Vardy has netted 108 Premier League goals since his debut, which he made aged 27.
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      &#160; &#160; &#160; • This was only the second time in Premier League history that a team has conceded three penalties at home (The first &#160; &#160; &#160; being Man United vs Liverpool in 2014).
      </h13>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
      As Jim Beglin so elegantly put in his commentary last night, ‘This season is bonkers’.
