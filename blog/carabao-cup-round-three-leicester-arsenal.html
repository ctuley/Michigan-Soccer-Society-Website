      <h12><b>Final Score: Leicester City 0 - 2 Arsenal</b></h12>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        The Carabao Cup cooked up a tasty Round 3 fixture as The Gunners made their way to the King Power stadium in search for a fourth victory in as many games this season. Leicester too had maintained a 100% record since the start of the 2020/21 season and looked like they were putting their post-lockdown form behind them. Both teams would have been eyeing a good start to the competition as it presents one of their more realistic chances of silverware this campaign. On a day that included a Kai Havertz hat-trick, a Newcastle mauling and a Jordan Pickford calamity (that’s a rare sight), I’m certain this wasn’t worth the two hours you spent watching it.

      <h10><b>1. Clash of the B-Teams</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Teams fighting in the top half of the Premier League often field weaker sides filled with squad players for league cup games, especially during the preliminary rounds. Most coaches do so in order to rest star players, while others use these as tests for fringe players looking to break into the team. Both, Brendan Rogers and Mikel Arteta, came under the latter, despite coming up against equal opposition. Leicester’s eleven didn’t feature even one player from their previous victory over Burnley, while Arsenal saw seven changes to their starting lineup (which would very easily have been 11 if half of their backline wasn’t injured). However, there were many on the pitch who weren’t simply names on a team sheet, instead, were fighting for places in the ‘A-Team’. Arsenal’s frontline comprised of Eddie Nketiah, Reiss Nelson and Nicolas Pepe as well as Bukayo Saka and Joe Willock in midfield. Arsenal’s attacking options are plentiful, and it is in games like these that players can make a mark and stake a claim. Unfortunately, not all of them could (more on that later).

      <h10><b>2. The Foxes Out-Foxed</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        Yes, the season has just begun. Yes, they’ve not had the normal preparation period they would have. Yes, Arsenal are much better defensively than they have been in recent memory. Nevertheless, Leicester should have been better in the attacking third. James Maddison made his first start since his unfortunate injury, along with Demarai Gray and Kelechi Iheanacho up front. The foxes looked bereft of ideas and were rarely able to threaten the Arsenal goal, barring a couple of good saves Leno made early in the first half. Perez and Praet were virtually ineffective when brought on as well. Rogers has placed his bet on Iheanacho, and with Leicester not actively looking for a new striker, he’s going to have to hope it pays off. Last night did not do anything to calm his nerves. Nothing came of for the Nigerian as he clocked in another disappointing 90 minutes in Leicester blue. Demarai Gray’s future was already looking grim and with new signing Cengiz Ünder coming in, now more than ever, he needs to show the potential everyone at the King Power believes he possesses. I shudder at what could become of Leicester City if Jamie Vardy were to get injured. Well, let's not forget, they'd still have their #11 putting in inch perfect crosses (TAA eat your heart out). Marc Albrighton: Truly Timeless.

      <h10><b>3. Nketiah Making a Name For Himself</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        From one strikeforce to another, Arsenal’s frontline was led by the electric Eddie Nketiah. He had already developed a good reputation for himself upon returning from his  loan spell at Leeds United in January 2020. In the eight months since then, the Arsenal fanbase has been split into those who believe he deserves to be the starting number nine, and those who back Frenchman Alexandre Lacazette. Regardless of who Arteta prefers, Nketiah has quietly been adding to his goal tally, with his strike last night coming after a similar winner against West Ham on the weekend. In an era where strikers are encouraged to balance their game, or in some cases abandon goal-scoring all together (Yes, looking at you Bobby Firmino), Nketiah is the perfect man to have in the box. He’s quick, he’s clever and he’s able to score the kind of goals only strikers can, the kind players like Anthony Martial have been criticised for not being able to score. With a heavy dependence on Aubameyang to provide goals for the team, Nketiah’s prowess in the 18-yard box will definitely help the team kick on, as the Arteta era gets into full swing.

      <h10><b>4. The Bukayo Saka Conundrum</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        How do you solve a problem like Bukayo Saka? Don’t get me wrong, it’s the best kind of problem to have, yet, it needs to be solved. Arsenal’s new number 7 has shown that he can play anywhere on the left flank - as a winger, wing-back or full-back. His diminutive stature, which might not be ideal for defensive roles, is easily balanced out by his intelligence. When playing as a left winger, he brings with him bags of creativity, which is potentially only bettered by Dani Ceballos and Mesut Ozil - where was he last night, by the way? With Aubameyang looking like he's settled down in his left wing position, is wing-back, the role Saka employed last night, his best bet? In my opinion, it probably is, and last night was evidence of it. Clearly Arsenal’s best player on the pitch, Saka practically hugged the touchline and found himself wide left and near the corner flag very often, while Nelson tucked in to play closer to the man up front. With three centre-backs shielding the goalkeeper, Saka has the freedom to bomb up and down the wings at will. But you lot have heard all of this before, a million times. So what’s with all the repetition? Well, the problem comes in the form of a Scottish phenomenon who I just happen to love. Kieran Tierney was brought in as much for his defensive discipline as he was for his attacking ability. Playing Tierney in that left center-back role is, as I see it, not ideal. In a perfect world, Arteta can get Auba, Saka and Tierney playing together in their best positions, alas, that is something we might never see. One thing is clear, however, if Bukayo Saka isn’t in Arteta’s ideal eleven, I’m #ArtetaOut.

      <h10><b>5. A Blessing In Disguise?</b></h10>
      <br></br>
      <h13>
        One look at the Leicester team sheet and you know that this club is not built to compete in four competitions. Leicester City have enjoyed five of the greatest years in their modern history, but neither can they match the traditional top 6 financially, nor do they have a super agent sending them talent after talent (Anyone knows who Connor Coady’s Portugese tutor is?). It will take time for Leicester to build a squad that can compete on all fronts and the best way to build towards that is by going as far as they can in the Europa League and finishing in a European spot for next season. In that sense, the Carabao Cup presents a needless distraction. If Leicester can rekindle some of their early season form from last year, they might be able to put themselves in a prime position for European spots, allowing them to kick on and become a force in the coming years. Let’s dial it back a bit though, and look at the short term. Provided Liverpool win their tie against Lincoln City (Does anyone have a 20 on Jurgen Klopp, he’ll probably not be at the game so…) the winner of this tie would have played them. Imagine. That Liverpool team going up against Wes Morgan, Christian Fuchs and Daniel Amartey. Entertainment of the highest order for the neutral, but spare a second for the Leicester fans. That Wes Morgan goal-line clearance though... really turning back the years. A 36 year old veteran, running at approximately 10 miles an hour, heading the ball away as it falls into the net - It truly is the magic of the Carabao Cup (yup, i just coined that term).
