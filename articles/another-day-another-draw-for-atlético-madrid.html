    <h12><b>Final Score: Athletic Club 1 - 1 Atlético Madrid</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Iker Muniain’s 37th-minute goal was quickly canceled out by Diego Costa in the 39th minute - who celebrated with a touching tribute to Atlético women’s Virginia Torrecilla after her surgery last month - and two of the league’s best defensive teams played out a 1-1 draw. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Atlético Continues Mediocre Form in La Liga</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Prior to the COVID-19 break, Atlético Madrid had two consecutive draws in La Liga against a solid Sevilla side and bottom-placed Espanyol. This can be explained by a number of injuries they sustained earlier in the season, including center backs Jose Maria Gimenez and Mario Hermoso, and striker Diego Costa. However, they had an abundance of time to recover during the break, and almost the entire squad was fit for this match - excluding Felipe Augusto and Joao Felix, who suffered mild injuries in training. Atlético were expected to win this match, but after Athletic Club’s Iker Munian shot home late in the first half, the Rojiblancos had to settle for one point courtesy of a 39th minute Diego Costa goal. They remain in sixth place, level on points with fifth-placed Getafe.

            Diego Simeone is notorious for his “park the bus” style of play with Atlético Madrid, and because of this, opposing teams find it very difficult to score against them. They have the second-best ‘goals against’ record in La Liga, coming into Sunday’s match having conceded 21 goals in 27 matches. Athletic Club entered the game implementing a crossing system, which allowed the full-backs Berchiche and Capa to get forward and try to pick out strikers Raul Garcia and Iñaki Williams. This worked quite well for them, as they had 4 shots on target, which is quite high for a team playing Atlético Madrid. Athletic Club could have easily won the game if it wasn’t for Atlético’s goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who had 3 saves.

    <h10><b>3. Munian Once Again Proves that he is a Class Above at Athletic Club</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Iker Munian broke the deadlock in Sunday’s match with a brilliant outside of the foot shot from a cross from Yuri Berchiche. He now has 5 goals and 2 assists in La Liga this season, which doesn’t do his performances for Athletic Club justice. He is the engine that controls Athletic’s attack, and the main distributor that moves the ball from side to side to open up the crossing game that their strikers rely on.

    <h10><b>4. Athletic Defense Makes Mistake, Costs them 3 Points</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Not even two minutes after Munian scored the first goal of the match, Atlético scored the leveler due to a lapse in concentration from Athletic Club’s center backs Yeray and Martinez. Koke threaded a pass through the two center backs, who were caught out of position, to Diego Costa, who had an easy tap-in finish. This is highly unusual for the two center backs, as they are some of the most consistent performers in the league, and are key pieces of a defense that had only conceded 23 goals entering Sunday’s match.

    <h10><b>5. Five Substitutions Proves to be Detrimental for Both Sides</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Eibar now sits in 16th place with 10 games left to play, only two points above the relegation line. Their schedule to end the year can be considered very difficult, as six of their matches are against top ten sides. However, their destiny is still in their hands, and wins against two of the teams below them could get them out of any potential jam. Mendilibar’s men will have to play like they did in the second half of Sunday’s match if they want any hope of staying up in La Liga.
