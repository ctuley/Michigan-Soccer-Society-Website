    <h12><b>Final Score: Borussia Dortmind 2 - 0 VfL Wolfsburg</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Dortmund comfortably defeated Wolfsburg 2-0 to keep pressure on rivals Bayern ahead of Der Klassiker. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Sancho Impresses Off the Bench</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While Dortmund were never at a point where they were truly struggling in this matchup, there was a certain lack of energy overall until Jadon Sancho was subbed into the game for Julian Brandt in the 60th minute. Sancho’s presence was felt throughout his cameo, and he was even able to tally his 16th assist of the season by setting up Achraf Hakimi for Dortmund’s second goal in the 78th minute. Sancho has been consistent for Dortmund since gaining a more active role with the club and the question remains about when Lucien Favre sees him coming back into the starting XI.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>2. Hummel’s Injury Could Potentially Result in Him Missing Tuesday’s Critical Game</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Before the game started, it was reported that star Dortmund center back Mats Hummels was having slight problems with his Achilles, but it was nothing major as he was able to start the match comfortably. However, Hummels was subbed off at halftime leading to concern regarding his injury and whether he will be available for the crucial upcoming game against Bayern. It was reported that Dortmund are not too worried as the injury is minor, but it will be interesting to see how he recovers and if he can play the full 90 minutes on Tuesday.

<!-- 3rd Row -------------------------------------------------->

  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>3. Quality over Quantity</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      One of Dortmund’s biggest strengths as a team is that they do not need chance after chance to find a way to get the ball in the back of the net. In fact, throughout this game they had very few chances. What makes Dortmund so dangerous is that they are clinical. They are comfortable controlling the ball in the midfield, not forcing anything offensively, and then taking advantage of defensive errors from the opposing team. In this game Dortmund’s two best chances were the two that ended up in the back of the net. This ability to patiently wait for openings and consistently finish them is something that Dortmund leverage throughout the Bundesliga and it is what makes their team strategy so unique.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Klaus Red Card</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The result of the game was absolutely cemented when Felix Klaus of Wolfsburg received a red card in the 82nd minute. The decision was originally overlooked by the referee, but VAR was used to determine the sending off. The decision was controversial as Wolfsburg players argued that it was unintentional, but regardless Wolfsburg had played aggressively and received several warnings throughout the game, so it was really no surprise in the end that the red was given.

  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Haaland’s Space Creation</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While young talisman Erling Haaland was not able to score yet another goal in this game, his influence off the ball was very apparent. Haaland’s presence in the box is one of his biggest strengths as he can draw several defenders on to him which creates space for other attackers in the box to receive crosses. In the first goal, two defenders in the box are attracted to Haaland which creates the space in the back for Guerreiro to finish the cross. We see a similar effect in the second goal where, during the counter-attack, Haaland’s presence in the center of the field attracts most of the defenders’ attention which opens up space on the right-wing for Hakimi to comfortably finish for Dortmund’s second. Overall, it is incredibly impressive how broad Haaland’s skill set is, especially at such a young age, and it will be exciting to see him get better and better from here.
