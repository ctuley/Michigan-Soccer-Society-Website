    <h12><b>Final Score: RB Leipzig 1 - 1 SC Freiburg</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Leipzig were held to a 1-1 draw at home against Freiburg, a major blow to their title hopes. Here are five takeaways from the match.

    <h10><b>1. Soccer is Back</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Following the global COVID pandemic and the suspension of major sports leagues throughout the world for months, the Bundesliga was the first major European league to return to action. Given Germany’s effectiveness in dealing with the pandemic, the return of the Bundesliga was obviously carefully and meticulously planned out. COVID has caused negative effects on the European football economy with many players and clubs uncertain about the future. As a careful return to football and sports will be necessary, the Bundesliga can be a model to follow for the rest of the leagues.
    </h13>
    <h13>
      With the strange circumstances and environment of the return, Julian Nagelsmann compared it to a tournament and made it clear that Leipzig was out to attack and win. “These nine [remaining Bundesliga games] are like the Euros, and we want to win them,” he noted. Due to injury and suspension to center backs Willi Orban and Dayot Upamecano respectively, Nagelsmann went for a very attacking lineup with no natural center backs. The lack of fans and momentum did seem to neutralize Leipzig’s home field advantage though and it was definitely interesting to be able to hear the interactions between the players and coaches.

            Ultimately this was another two points dropped for Leipzig which meant their gap with Bayern further widened. With Dortmund’s emphatic 4-0 victory over Schalke and Gladbach and Leverkusen in the mix as well, Leipzig face a contested challenge for the Top 4 as well as the title and cannot afford to lose points with such a dominant performance.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            While Leipzig have proven that they can compete toe-to-toe against big teams with draws in both their meetings with Bayern and a dominating 4-0 aggregate victory over Tottenham in the Champions League, these wasteful draws and losses against lesser opposition may cost them the title.

        Though Leipzig dominated most of the possession, key set pieces defined the outcome of the match. Freiburg were quick to make the most of their set pieces and limited opportunities. Manuel Gulde’s clever but perhaps lucky flick from a corner resulted in their only goal. Freiburg looked dangerous with their corners and were only a few centimeters away from stealing a win in Leipzig when Robin Koch’s header was ruled offside by VAR. Freiburg’s resilience under Christian Streich has made them very tough to play against as they beat Leipzig in their previous meeting back in October. The point sends them to 7th and creeping into the European positions. Streich and Co. can look forward to their next few games as they face relegation-threatened Werder and Frankfurt in very poor form.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Leipzig Deserved to Win: Their Poor Finishing Cost Them</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Leipzig pinned down the entire Freiburg team in their own half for large parts of the game. They dominated the possession and the shots but seemed disjointed in attack especially in the first half and signs of not playing for 2 months were clear. Freiburg goalie Alexander Schwolow was very busy and deserving of man-of-the-match in my opinion. His 7 saves and a crucial save to deny a Timo Werner 1 vs 1 kept Freiburg in the game. Substitute Ademola Lookman also missed a close-range 1 vs 1 along with more efforts from Yussuf Poulson and Christopher Nkunku. Nagelsmann’s other attacking substitutions with Marcel Sabitzer and Patrik Schick helped reenergize the attack as they found the equalizer with a Poulsen strike and searched for the win but in the end, it was too little too late as inconsistent finishing ultimately haunted Leipzig.

<!-- 5th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Timo Werner’s Struggles Continue</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Werner found it difficult to receive service and use his deadly pace. Against Freiburg’s very defensive low-block, he was forced to drift wide and drop deep into midfield to receive the ball. Like many other Leipzig players like Yussuf Poulson and sub Ademola Lookman, his finishing was wasteful and subpar. After a very hot start in the first half of the season, Werner has cooled down with only 1 goal in his last 8 games in the Bundesliga. Performances like these raise questions about Werner’s effectiveness in a heavy-possession team against low-blocks should he join Liverpool next season.
