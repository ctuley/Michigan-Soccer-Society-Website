    <h12><b>Final Score: Borussia Dortmund 4 - 0 FC Schalke</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Soccer, by some miracle, is finally back! The Bundesliga kicked off again this Saturday - the first major league to do so - and it could not be more welcomed by soccer fans everywhere. There were plenty of great matchups for the return, but none more anticipated than the Revierderby. Schalke traveled to an empty Signal Iduna Park to take on local rivals Dortmund, but the result didn’t quite match the anticipation. Here are my five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Dortmund Haven’t Skipped A Beat, Even Without Key Players</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Dortmund picked up their fifth league victory in a row in a thoroughly dominant fashion. They played fast, their passing was sharp, and their finishing was clinical. Dortmund didn’t create a ton of great chances - the expected goals for the match was 1.45 - 0.35 (understat.com) - but Schalke struggled to create much for themselves. Dortmund didn’t press a ton either - their passes per defensive action was 12.84 (understat.com) - but when they did it caused Schalke trouble. The second goal was a great example of this. The press forced a sloppy pass from Schalke goalkeeper Marcus Schubert which fell to Mahmoud Dahoud, and a quick break by Dortmund ended in a nice finish by Raphael Guerreiro to make it 2-0 before halftime. Dortmund continued to laugh in the face of xG advocates everywhere through clinical finishing, now outscoring their xG for the season by more than 25 goals (fbref.com). The highlight of these great finishes was Guerreiro’s outside of the boot goal for his second and Dortmund’s fourth. The fact that Dortmund can still look this dominant without Reus, Witsel, Can, and Sancho (for 80 minutes) should be a worrying sign for Bayern Munich - who is only a point ahead at the time of writing.

            In the opening moments of the match, Schalke was pressing intensely, and Dortmund was having trouble playing the ball out of the back. It looked like it was about to be another classic Revierderby. Unfortunately, that intense press didn’t last long, and Dortmund took control. 4-0 was probably a bit harsh on Schalke - see the expected goals for the match above - but Dortmund certainly dominated this match. Schalke struggled in possession - the exact opposite of Dortmund in fact. They looked slow, their passing was sloppy, and their poor finishing hardly mattered because they didn’t create anything.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            David Wagner tried to switch things up at halftime - going from a match of Dortmund’s 3-4-3 to their more typical 4-4-2 diamond - but it only made them more vulnerable to Dortmund’s counter attack. They did look more dangerous going forward after the change, but they still created very little in the way of chances. Some of this could be attributed to being rusty after the two month hiatus, but this is a trend that started well before the stoppage of play. Schalke haven’t won since January, and they have failed to have an xG of over 1.0 in all but one game since that last win <i>(fbref.com)</i>. Eight games without a win is troubling, and even more so with their European hopes slipping away.

            Someone has cursed American soccer. Almost every major American player in Europe has dealt with injuries at various points this season. People wondered how long the US would make it without an injury after soccer’s restart. They didn’t even make it to kickoff. It was supposed to be a big day for 17 year old American Gio Reyna. He was about to make his first start for Dortmund today, but it was not meant to be. Reyna picked up a leg muscle injury just before kickoff and was unable to make his first start. Will the US ever have all of its great young talent be healthy at the same time? I’m not holding my breath.

    <h10><b>4. Soccer Without Fans is Strange, but Tolerable</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Bundesliga is known for its great fans, especially those at Dortmund. So seeing the Signal Iduna Park without fans before the match made me a little uneasy of how my enjoyment of the match would hold up. Thankfully, once the match started, the lack of fans didn’t sour my experience too much. I really only noticed it during stoppages of play, which became quite funny when the lack of crowd noise allowed me to notice the sound of a plane flying overhead. The one big complaint I have is that the match didn’t feel like a derby. Maybe it was because the match was so one-sided, but the fans just bring a certain energy to a derby match, and it doesn’t quite feel the same without them. However, the game was still enjoyable, and the lack of fans will be fine after getting used to it.

    <h10><b>5. Soccer is Back - How has the Break Influenced Performances?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      It was nice to finally feel some anticipation for something. With a return to normalcy not yet in sight, there isn’t a ton to look forward to, especially on television. It doesn’t seem that important, but the anticipation for some form of entertainment can get you through a long day at work, school, or even another day of quarantine. With ESPN’s Michael Jordan documentary “The Last Dance” coming to an end this weekend, the only other thing on television I’ve had to look forward to is Jeopardy! re-runs. Thankfully, the sport we all love is back and will give us something to look forward to as we charge through this pandemic. As much as I love Alex Trebek, he’s no replacement for the beautiful game.
