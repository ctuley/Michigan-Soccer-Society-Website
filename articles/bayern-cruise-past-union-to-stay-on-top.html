    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Bayern Munich came out with a gritty 2-0 win against mid-table team Union Berlin in what was a dominant, yet rusty showcase. Here are 5 takeaways from the match:s

    <h10><b>1. Lewandowski Continues Pursuit of Gerd Müller’s Single Season Goal Scoring Record</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Bayern star Robert Lewandowski, who would have missed this match due to injury had it not been for the COVID-19 delay, continued his superb form by netting home a penalty in the 40th minute of the match. Lewandowski now has an incredible 25 goals in his 23 games played in the Bundesliga. This puts him well on pace to potentially overtake Gerd Müller’s all-time single-season goal scoring record in the Bundesliga of 40 goals. This record has stood without challenge since the 1971-1972 season, which further shows the extent of Lewandowski’s fantastic form this season.

            Despite the disappointing final score for the mid-table team, Union Berlin should be far from ashamed from their performance on Sunday. While Bayern was able to conjure up a total of 13 shots, with 3 being on target, a huge majority of these opportunities were half-chances at best. The frustration from players like Gnabry, Müller, and Goretzka was apparent as they had shot after shot blocked by the in-form Berlin defense.

          <br></br>
          <h13>While Bayern did control the midfield throughout the match, they struggled to break through the final third consistently. The late substitution of Kingsley Coman for Goretzka was able to spur some late creativity and pace, but Bayern’s all-star offense was still unable to create many decent chances from open play.</h13>

    <h10><b>3. Set Pieces and Mistakes Can Change a Game</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While Union Berlin’s defense stood strong throughout the match, two specific moments of lapses in judgment ultimately decided the final result. Late in the first half, Neven Subotic’s late challenge on Leon Goretzka led to a penalty, which was converted by Robert Lewandowski. This was the only real crucial mistake in an otherwise solid defensive first half showcase from the Berlin side. Late in the second half, sloppy man marking following a cross after a corner resulted in Benjamin Pavard’s header going in the back of the net. This just shows that no matter how high quality of a game a team is having, two small mistakes can change the entire outcome of the match.

    <br></br>
    <h10><b>4. Can Bayern Defend Counter-Attacks Against Stronger Teams?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Throughout this game, we saw several instances of pacey Bayern left-back, Alphonso Davies, darting down the wings. This results in some openings in their defense being exploited by the Union Berlin offense, especially in the first half-hour of the game. While Union is not known for being strong offensively, this leads to questions regarding Bayern’s ability to cover this lapse in the defense against stronger opposition. Manager Hans-Dieter Flick will no doubt keep this in the back of his mind when helping develop Davies for future games, as he clearly prefers him as a starter for the current team.

<!-- 5th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h10><b>5. Is Bayern’s Offense Lacking Creativity?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      There is no question that Bayern dominated this match in terms of possession, and control of the midfield. Goretzka had several key moments of chemistry with wingers Gnabry and Müller, however, the midfield trio failed to effectively link with striker Lewandowski to create clear-cut chances from open play. There is no doubt the Union Berlin defense was in good form on the day, but a team with the offensive capabilities of Bayern Munich should not have much trouble breaking through this. Throughout the match, there were several sloppy giveaways from the midfield and offensive players of Bayern, which showed signs of rustiness after this long break. Only time will tell if Sunday’s performance can truly be attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak, or whether teams are starting to crack Bayern’s offensive formula.
