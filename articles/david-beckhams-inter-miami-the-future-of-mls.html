      Inter Miami was all the talk heading into the 2020 MLS season. It’s not surprising when you have David Beckham running the show in South Beach. Prior to the suspension of the league, Inter Miami faced arguably a side coming off the best season in MLS history led by Carlos Vela in LAFC. In a 1-0 defeat, Inter Miami showed encouraging signs on their MLS debut. Even if the new MLS side finishes last in the Eastern Conference this year, the club is bound for future success for 3 key reasons.

            David Beckham equals success. Over the course of his 20-year career, the Englishman played for European juggernauts including Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan, and Paris Saint Germain racking up 6 Premier League titles, a Champions League title, a La Liga title, and Ligue 1 title. Moreover, Beckham joined the LA Galaxy from 2007-2012 winning 2 MLS Cups, inserting his name into American culture inspiring future generations. Beckham knows how to win, not just in the U.S., but also in Europe. These two reasons alone will help attract talent to Inter Miami for years to come whether that be veterans looking for a new opportunity, young players looking to jumpstart their pathway to Europe, or eager kids wanting to learn from the best in the developmental academy. Additionally, David Beckham has built a beautiful world-class facility for the club in order for players to thrive in the league.          </h13>

      David Beckham has connections. Inter Miami has frequently made headlines saying that Messi or Ronaldo may join Beckham in South Beach. Beckham won’t deny it either. In an interview with ESPN FC, he articulates that he would be honored for Messi and Ronaldo to play for his team. With Messi almost 33-years old and Ronaldo 35-years old, the potential for these GOATs to be playing in the United States may not be far off. Beckham also shares that many international players have inquired about playing for his team. Beckham’s first big signing was Rodolfo Pizarro, a 26-year old Mexican international from Monterrey. Beckham hopes to follow the successful LAFC and Atlanta United models with Pizarro by bringing in the Velas, Josef Martínezes, and Almiróns and making the club MLS’s South American team. Not to mention, but David Beckham has learned managerial styles and tactics from the great Sir Alex Fergusson, I wouldn't be suprised if Beckham uses Sir Alex Fergusson as a consultant for success.

      Of course, other superstars that have been linked to the club include Griezman, Falcao, James Rodriguez, Theo Walcott, David Silva, Luis Suarez, Modric, and Bale. Anything seems possible when you’re David Beckham. Although these players are older and the MLS has been scrutinized for being a “retirement league,” just imagine what players of this stardom could do for the young club and more broadly soccer in the U.S. If a big name from Europe finds themselves in South Beach, this means more money and more success.

            Location, location, location. For players looking to come to America, Miami is the perfect place to call home, with its warm climate, beautiful beaches, and championship roots. South Florida will expect nothing but excellence. Nonetheless, the area has a high Latin population that is passionate about soccer. In 2014, a match between the Colombia Brazil drew 73,429 fans, which is greater than most Dolphins games. In 2019, Colombia and Brazil rematch 65,232 fans. In 2019, La Liga almost hosted a league game between Villareal and Atletico Madrid to capitalize on the ardent market. Even NBA superstar LeBron James commented on the soccer culture in Miami saying, “I think this is a great town for soccer. There are a lot of soccer players here. There is a lot of great youth soccer here.” Miami is an emerging soccer city full of culture and die-hard fans. David Beckham just awakened a beast.

      Inter Miami will be successful it’s just a matter of when. David Beckham has all the tools at his disposal to win MLS Cups. From connections in Europe and South America to world-class facilities to top-tier coaches to an ecstatic group of supporters in Vice City 1896, it’s hard to see Beckham’s project ending in failure. It will be exciting to see how Inter Miami shapes the future of MLS soccer.
