    <h12><b>Final Score: FC Bayern Munchen 5 - 2 Eintracht Frankfurt</b></h12>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Bayern Munich pulls off an important victory at the expense of a sinking Eintracht Frankfurt, with the Austrian defender Martin Hinteregger getting an interesting hattrick of goals as he features on both sides of the scoresheet. Here are five key takeaways from today’s exciting match:

    <h10><b>1. Hansi Flick’s Bayern Continues Their Record-Breaking Run</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Since the sacking of Niko Kovac after the disastrous reverse fixture, Hansi Flick’s interim period at Bayern proved to be too good to turn down. Since Bayern appointed Flick as the full-time manager, he hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down nor that a “honeymoon” period has ended as did with Solskjaer’s Manchester United side, someone he was compared to earlier this season. He has proven himself to be worthy of being Die Roten’s manager, having collected 43 out of a possible 51 points, with an average of over 3 goals per game. This is incredible, even by Bayern’s lofty standards, and he had an impeccable Champions League record to go with it until soccer stopped abruptly due to COVID-19.
    </h13>
    <h13>
      Bayern is on course to win a record-breaking 8th consecutive league title, and even with Der Klassiker coming up this Tuesday, they are still 4 points ahead of second-place Dortmund. This hot run of form brings back fresh memories from the golden days of Pep Guardiola, however, it looks even better. With Pep bringing his own philosophy to Munich, despite the success, he was often viewed as unfit for Die Roten. But Flick, on the other hand, staying true to Bayern’s high-pressing style of play, might be the best thing that has happened to the club since the Champions League triumph of 2013. Reviving the club’s Bavarian identity, bringing the local hero Müller back into the limelight, fighting with the not-so-popular sporting director over his demands, he has already established himself as a firm fan favorite. With a Bundesliga title under his belt, he would be untouchable, and that is looking like a pretty likely scenario.

    <h10><b>2. Bayern’s Defense, can They Stop the Likes of Haaland and Sancho on Tuesday?</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Apart from the two goals conceded from corners, Bayern’s defense was absolutely world-class today. Neuer, who finally signed a contract extension earlier this week, proved today why he is still one of the world’s best keepers. Alexander Nubel will still face fierce competition for the first-team spot when he comes in next season. With the number of key saves he made today, and his quality in possession - reminding us of his 2014 World Cup-winning season - it is clear that Nubel would be learning from the best next season.
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With the re-emergence of Boateng in recent matches, his key tackle prevented an amazing counter-attack in this first half, as a result, newcomer Lucas Hernandez will be pushed further down the pecking order. Flick has also discovered Alaba’s center-back talents and Bayern’s heart looks stronger than ever. With Davies experiencing an amazing breakthrough season, and Pavard proving himself to be best at right-back, Bayern’s defense is one of the best in Europe. However even with this amount of talent, they struggled to defend set-plays from Frankfurt. However strong the zonal marking might be, a team still needs to go out and prevent players like Hinteregger from making a run and scoring headers. Bayern fell victim to this twice today and need to make sure it doesn’t happen again on Tuesday, as Erling Braut Haland will be there to capitalize on those chances.

    <h10><b>3. Frankfurt, oh Frankfurt! Mistakes Push Towards Relegation</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
       Mistakes have been a recurring theme for Frankfurt this season, and ever since the reverse fixture - the 5-1 scoreline didn’t reflect their true performance, but rather Kovac and Bayern’s inability - they have been on a horrendous run. Worst away record in the Bundesliga, worst in away goals conceded, they have surely topped charts they didn’t want to this season. With 4 consecutive defeats, they draw even closer to relegation, and after the highs of last season, this seems like a nightmare. However, some trends could be found in these defeats, which they lose with a deficit of 2 or more goals regularly. Here are my observations on their game:
    </h13>
    <br></br>
    <li style="color: #182436;">Very low in possession usually, no pressing the opposition, thus attacking threat very low.</li>
    <li style="color: #182436;">Defense spread out too much, exposing a lot of space.</li>
    <li style="color: #182436;">Vulnerable to counter attacks.</li>
    <li style="color: #182436;">Goals conceded due to too much space, and even with an amazing goalkeeper in Trapp, it isn’t enough.</li>
    <li style="color: #182436;">Kostic / Silva sometimes step up, getting marvelous 1 on 1s, but they can’t capitalize on them.</li>

    <h10><b>4. Today’s big name for the Eagles: Martin Hinteregger</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Much like the rest of the Schalke team, midfielder Weston McKennie struggled to get on the ball in the first half. After 35 minutes, he was tied for the least amount of touches in the team with 10. Once play resumed in the second half, McKennie was the engine in the middle of a reinvigorated team. He began to impose his physicality and won a series of tackles which allowed him to find his teammates in wide areas. In the 53rd minute, McKennie won the ball in midfield, and sprung a counter-attack which concluded after Jiří Pavlenka stuffed Benito Raman’s shot from a tight angle. However, McKennie, and Schalke’s rejuvenation was cut short when McKennie was substituted after attempting a risky tackle while already on a yellow card. Although McKennie will miss Schalke’s next match due to yellow card accumulation, perhaps after he returns, Schalke can use his tenacious style of play to inspire an end of season push.

    <h10><b>5. Die Roten’s Attack One Season Post-Two-Goats</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Bringing an end to a beautiful era in Bayern history, Arjen Robben and Frank Ribery left the club last season. Their positions on the flanks are hard ones to fill, and a problem that the club has been trying to solve for the past couple of years. With the Leroy Sane saga last season, and unimpressive performances by the Barcelona loanee, Coutinho, it seems like the Bayern attack should be facing one of their hardest years. However, since the appointment of Hansi Flick, that is as far from the truth as it could be. With Gnabry continuing to impress and Flick rejuvenating Müller - who has bagged an incredible 16 assists and 8 goals - Bayern’s attack is stronger than ever. As Lewandowski is arguably one of the best strikers in the world - scoring 27 goals in the league this season - Bayern have managed more than 50 goals since Flick arrived at the helm. That also has been complemented by Davies and Goretzka’s exciting talents, both enjoying breakthrough seasons, even with Goretzka spending a lot of time out due to injuries. The list is never-ending - with Kimmich and Alaba both fancying - and sometimes scoring - shots outside of the penalty area, and reliable options in Coman and Perisic on the bench, Bayern is an unstoppable force. Dortmund’s Sancho and Haaland aren’t the only reasons for excitement in Tuesday’s Der Klassiker. Bayern, as always, will be a tough opponent to face.
