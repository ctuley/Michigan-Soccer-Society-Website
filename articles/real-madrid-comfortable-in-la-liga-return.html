    <br></br>
    <h13>
      With goals from Kroos, Ramos - assisted by Hazard - and Marcelo, Real Madrid ride a dominant first half to a comfortable 3-1 win against Eibar. Here are five key takeaways:

    <h10><b>1. Zidane Favors Experience Over Youth</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Almost everyone expected Zidane to use the same line-up that he’d used for the majority of the La Liga season before the break (Courtois, Carvajal-Varane-Ramos-Mendy, Kroos-Casemiro-Valverde, Rodrygo-Benzema-Vinicius), as Madrid had been quite successful with this group so far - sitting second in the league standings. Instead, Zidane opted for a more experienced set of players, using Marcelo over Mendy and Modric over Valverde. As Hazard was finally healthy after a slew of injuries, he started over Vinicius. Zidane likes to use players that he trusts in bigger games, and this match met that standard as it was the first match his team had played in over 100 days.

            Real Madrid’s captain is now 34 years old, and while he is still an excellent player, it is inevitable that he will leave Madrid in the coming years. Zidane is attempting to prepare for this loss by rotating his star center back as much as possible, giving Ramos’ successor Eder Militao as much game time as possible. One would think that Raphael Varane and Miltao could handle Eibar’s attack, who have only scored 27 goals this year, but this thought was proven to be incorrect. As soon as Ramos was substituted at the 61st minute, Real Madrid’s defense became visibly shaken, and it was clear that there was a lack of communication between defenders. This will concern Madrid fans, as vice-captains Varane and Marcelo were both still playing. Madrid’s defense will have to learn to play without Ramos, or they will struggle a lot in the future.

    <h10><b>3. Eibar Rally in 2nd Half, Prove they are a Force to be Reckoned With</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      While Madrid dominated the first half, Eibar walked all over the 13-time European champions in the second half. Whatever José Luis Mendilibar told his team in the half time talk motivated them greatly, and they came out flying in the second half. They controlled possession for the first 30 minutes of the second half, and Sergi Enrich headed off of the crossbar in the 57th minute. Three minutes later, Eibar got lucky as a deflected shot bounced off Pedro Bigas and snuck past Thibaut Courtois. Los Armeros was unlucky not to finish any other chances, as they had 4 shots on target in the second half.

            Zidane usually does quite well with his substitutions, it is one of his greatest strengths as a manager. Today, however, we saw the bad side of Zidane’s substitutional management. He got quite caught up in Marcelo’s excellent first-half performance to realize that easing him back into play was smarter than giving him a full 90-minute shift. Instead, Zidane decided to replace right-back Dani Carvajal, who has never had problems with fitness, with left-back Ferland Mendy. Mendy, who hasn’t played right-back for Madrid all season, was noticeably lost in this foreign position. This was one of the factors that led to Eibar controlling the second half.
          </h13>
          <br></br>
          <h13>
            One player that all Madrid fans had been waiting to see was Marco Asensio, who had been out for the entire season prior to the break with a torn ACL. Most fans expected him to start in the right-wing position on Sunday night, but Rodrygo ended up getting the nod. This was well thought out by Zidane, as it would have been a waste to give Asensio the start and risk him running himself into another injury. It was expected, however, for Asensio to come on for Rodrygo, to at least get a bit of game time to stretch his legs. This didn’t happen, as Zidane chose out-of-favor Gareth Bale to come on in the 61st minute. As Bale is expected to leave in the summer transfer window, it is a strange move for Zidane to pick him over the future star Asensio.

    <h10><b>5. Eibar Will have to Fight to Avoid Relegation</b></h10>
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Eibar now sits in 16th place with 10 games left to play, only two points above the relegation line. Their schedule to end the year can be considered very difficult, as six of their matches are against top ten sides. However, their destiny is still in their hands, and wins against two of the teams below them could get them out of any potential jam. Mendilibar’s men will have to play like they did in the second half of Sunday’s match if they want any hope of staying up in La Liga.
