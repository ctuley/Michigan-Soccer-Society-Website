      If you mention the name Dwight Gayle in front of a Liverpool fan, they’ll likely shake their head in disgust.

      May 5th, 2014, Liverpool had a 3-0 lead over Crystal Palace. Three goals in nine minutes leveled the game, including two from Gayle. Liverpool’s collapse was part of a larger heartbreak as they fell short of the Premier League title by two points.

    <h13>
      The 29-year-old diminutive striker who now plays for Newcastle United has had many memorable moments in the Premier League — but where Gayle truly has shined is in the Championship, the second division of English football.
    </h13>
    <img src="../articles-img/the-case-for-gabriel-jesus/the-case-for-gabriel-jesus-3.png" class="img-responsive" style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width:85%">

      He left Crystal Palace and signed with Newcastle United in 2016 following their relegation from the top-flight. Gayle was handed the number nine shirt and took the division by storm. He scored four goals in his first four games. That season he had seven games in which he scored more than one goal.
    </h13>

<!-- 4th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Gayle totaled a team-high 23 goals in 34 appearances carrying the Magpies back to the Premiership. But when Newcastle returned to the first division, Gayle disappeared. He managed just six goals in 35 appearances.
    </h13>

<!-- 5th Row -------------------------------------------------->
<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      The Magpies avoided relegation relatively comfortably, however, it was clear they needed a more physical presence up top. Newcastle made a loan swap deal with Championship side West Bromich Albion which saw Gayle head to the Hawthorns and striker Salomón Rondón to St. James Park.

    <h13>
      Back in the Championship, Gayle returned to form. He netted another 23 goals in 39 appearances. Gayle has averaged 0.59 goals per game in the Championship and 0.20 goals per game in the Premier League. The numbers are not all that surprising considering the difference in the level of play between the two divisions, but the Championship is one of the most grueling and unpredictable leagues in the world. His success in that division is not just down to the lesser ability of players as compared to the Premier League.

    <h13>
      Gayle’s best position according to Football Manager is as a poacher forward. According to FM “The Poacher sits on the shoulder of the last defender looking to break the defensive line and run onto through balls from the midfield”. This role suits Gayle in real life and in the video game because he is so quick and is an expert at timing runs behind the defense. In the Premier League, there are fewer opportunities to run in behind and Gayle doesn’t offer much support in the buildup play.
    </h13>

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      In 2017-18 with Newcastle he averaged 13 passes per game while his replacement, Rondón, averaged 23 passes per game with Newcastle in 2018-19. Poachers are becoming rarer at the highest level of football because teams are asking their strikers to be more involved in the buildup play.

    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Gayle was able to be so successful in the Championship because the 2016-17 Newcastle squad and the 2018-19 West Brom side were able to control the majority of their games. This allowed Gayle to focus on what he does best, staying high up the pitch and scoring goals.

<section class="articles-white">
  <div class="articles-padding" style="line-height: 1.2;">
    <br></br>
    <h13>
      Don’t get me wrong, his goal-scoring rate in the second division is elite but until and unless Gayle develops his passing game he won’t be starting many games in the Premier League.
    </h13>

<section class="articles-white">

    <br></br>
    <h13>
Gayle will likely leave Newcastle in the coming transfer window and with his asking price reduced due to the coronavirus, expect Championship clubs to be in a feeding frenzy over the “King of the Championship.”    </h13>
